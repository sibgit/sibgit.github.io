**About "Additional Tasks"**  
As you will see, some of the exercises contain an **Additional Tasks** section.
These are tasks you can do if you have completed the regular part of the
exercise but there is still time in the exercise session. Additional Tasks will
*not* be corrected in class, but you can find corrections for them in the
exercise solutions.

<br>
<br>

## Configuring Git
Before starting with the exercises, make sure that you have done the minimal
Git configuration by setting your **user name** and **email** address in Git:
```yaml
git config --global user.name "First-name Last-name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Examples:
git config --global user.name "Alice Smith"
git config --global user.email alice.smith@wonder.org
```

Optionally you can also change the **default editor** used by Git, e.g. if you
are more comfortable with `nano` than `vim`:
```yaml
git config --global core.editor nano  # Set default editor to nano.
git config --global core.editor vim   # Set default editor to vim (the default).
```

To see the config values that are currently set, the commands are the following:
```yaml
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
git config --get core.editor

# Show all config values at once and where they are set.
git config --list --show-origin
```

## Exercise 1 - Your first commit [30 min]
**Objectives:** learn to create a new Git repository, add files to it, and
make commits.  

Welcome to the first exercise of this Git course! This is a warm-up, so you
will be guided step-by-step on exactly what you need to do.

<br>

### Part A: create a new repo from scratch and make a first commit

1. **Change directory** into `exercise_1/test-project` and list the
   directory's content using the following shell commands:
   ```yaml
   cd exercise_1/test-project
   ls -l
   ```

   You should see that it contains files reminiscent of a simple scripting
   project, e.g. a data analysis pipeline (here written in Python).
   ```sh
     test-project
      ├── doc
      │   └── user-guide.pdf
      ├── README.md
      ├── script.py
      ├── script.pyc
      └── tests
          ├── output.csv
          ├── tests.py
          └── tests.pyc
   ```
   <br>

2. **Initialize a new Git repository** at the root of the `test-project`
   directory:
   * Create a new Git repo in the current working directory with the command:
     ```yaml
     git init
     ```
   * Initializing a new Git repo creates a **hidden `.git` directory**. You
     can view this directory by running the shell command:
     ```yaml
     ls -la
     ```

     :fire:
     **Important:** this directory is where Git stores the history of your
     repository (as well as various settings). If you delete it,
     **you will lose all your version control history (and settings)** for
     the current repo. You can do this if e.g. you want to start the exercise
     from scratch again.

     <br>

3. **Display the status of files** in the working tree (i.e. the `test-project`
   directory):
   * Run the command:
     ```yaml
     git status
     ```
   * :question:
     **Question:** what is the status of the files in your working directory?

   <br>

4. **Stage the files** `README.md`, `script.py`, `doc/user-guide.pdf`,
   `tests/output.csv` and `tests/tests.py` (i.e. all files except the `*.pyc`
   files, which are some sort of "python cache" files we don't want to track).  
   * The command to stage files is: `git add <files or directories>`. For
     instance, `git add README.md` will stage the file `README.md`.
   * :owl:
     **Reminder:** *staging* a file is a synonym of *adding to the Git index*.
   * To make sure that you have staged the files correctly, run the command
     **`git status`**. The output of the command should look like this:
     ```txt
     Changes to be committed:
        	new file:   README.md
        	new file:   doc/user-guide.pdf
        	new file:   script.py
        	new file:   tests/output.csv
        	new file:   tests/tests.py

     Untracked files:
        	script.pyc
        	tests/tests.pyc
     ```
     <br>

5. **Add a first commit** to the repo with the commit message
   `"Initial commit for test project"`.
   * The command to make a commit is:
     **`git commit -m "<commit message>"`**
     (or, in the long form: `git commit --message "<commit message>"`)
   * After the commit is done, run the following commands:  
     * **`git log`**: to display the repository's history. At this point you
       should have a single commit, that looks like (your exact
       values for commit hash, date, etc. will differ):
       ```txt
       commit a0da6303e9d6dfc34986f959a076721e153f382d (HEAD -> main)
       Author: Your Name <your.email@example.org>
       Date:   Mon Oct 14 13:55:08 2024 +0200

           Initial commit for test project
       ```
     * **`git show`**: to have a look at the content of your commit.  
       :question:
       **Question:** why are the details of the `doc/user-guide.pdf` file not
       displayed by `git show`?

       :pushpin:
       **Note:** when the amount of text to be printed by `git show` exceeds one
       screen, the content is shown with the GNU program `less`. In `less`, you
       can use your keyboard arrow keys to move up/down, and press `q` to exit and
       return to the shell.

<br>

### Part B: commit an update to a tracked file

In this section, we will make an update to the `README.md` file, and then
create a new commit that adds this change.

1. **Open the `README.md` file** in your favorite text editor.
   * Change the 3rd line of the file to:
     > Demo project for the Git course. This will be great!
   * Save your changes and close the file.
   * Run `git status`: the file `README.md` should now be listed as modified:
     ```txt
     Changes not staged for commit:
	       modified:   README.md

     Untracked files:
    	   script.pyc
         tests/
     ```
   <br>

2. **Display the changes** to files in the working tree:
   * Run the command `git diff`, which displays the difference in tracked
     files between the working tree and the Git index (staging area).
     ```yaml
     git diff
     git diff README.md  # Gives the same result, as only README.md was modified.
     ```
   * It will show that `README.md` has one line removed (shown in red,
     prefixed with `-`), and one line added (shown in green, prefixed with `+`).
     ```diff
     -Demo project for the Git course.
     +Demo project for the Git course. This will be great!
     ```
   <br>

3. **Commit the changes** you just made:
   * Add/stage the changes made to `README.md` with `git add`.
     Remember that each time you modify a file and want to include these
     changes into your next commit, you have to `git add` that file again.
   * :fire:
     **Tip:** to stage all modified files at once, you can use the
     **`git add -u`** shortcut. In this case it does not make a lot of
     difference as there is only 1 modified file, but if there are many of
     them, this command can be useful.
   * Run `git status` again: you should see that the `README.md` file is now
     listed under `Changes to be committed:` (in green).
   * Commit your changes with the message `"Make README file more cheerful"`.

<br>

### Part C: adding files to the `.gitignore` list

At this point, the only files that should be left **untracked** in our
repository are the two `*.pyc` files (you can verify this by running
`git status`). Since we are never going to track these files, we would like
to **permanently ignore** them, so that they stop being listed as *untracked*.

1. **Add `*.pyc` files to `.gitignore`**:
   * At the root of the working tree, create a `.gitignore` file with the name
     of the files to ignore. We can also use the pattern `*.pyc` to ignore all
     files ending in `.pyc`.

     :fire:
     **Tip**: you can create the `.gitignore` in any text editor you like,
     but you can also easily generate it with a shell command:
     ```yaml
     echo "*.pyc" > .gitignore
     ```
   * Now run the `git status` command again: you should see that you still
     have an untracked file: the `.gitignore` file you just created
     :sweat_smile: !
   * :question:
     **Question:** how should we deal with this untracked file? Should it be
     added to the repo, or added to the ignore list ?  
     <br>

2. **Add a new commit with the `.gitignore`** file:
   * Stage the `.gitignore` file.
   * Make a new commit with commit message `"Add *.pyc to ignore list"`.

   At the end of this step, your working tree should now be "clean": when you
   run `git status`, the output should be:
   ```txt
   On branch main
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```
  <br>

 3. **Display the (modest) history of your Git repo** with the following
    variations of the `git log` command. Observe how history is displayed by
    each command:
     * `git log`  
     * `git log --pretty=oneline`
     * `git log --oneline`
     * `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`
    <br>

    With the current history of our git repo, the output of
    `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` is the same as
    `git log --oneline`. This will however change when we start working with
    **branches**, and the longer version of the command will become very
    useful.

    **So let's create a Git shortcut named `adog`** for it:  
      * The command to create this shortcut is:
        ```yaml
        git config --global alias.adog "log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"
        ```
      * Test your new shortcut by typing: `git adog`.
      * Your commit history should look like this (commit ID values will differ):
          ```txt
          * 81d03aa (HEAD -> main) Add *.pyc to ignore list
          * 029a389 Make README file more cheerful
          * da59f94 Initial commit for test project
          ```
      * :fire: **Tip:** to list your defined Git aliases, use:
        `git config --list | grep ^alias`

<br>

### Additional Tasks (if you have time)

For some of the next steps, we will need an additional file named
`personal_notes.md`, as well as a change in the `script.py` file.  
**Let's generate this file/changes** by running the following command at the
root of the `test-project` directory:
   ```yaml
   echo "Let's keep this local" > personal_notes.md
   echo "adding a bad line..." >> script.py

   # You can then visualize the changes by running:
   git status
   git diff
   ```

<br>

1. **Removing content from the Git index (unstaging)**.
   * Start by staging all untracked and modified files with `git add --all`.
     The status of your files should look like:
     ```txt
     Changes to be committed:
         new file:   personal_notes.md
         modified:   script.py
     ```

   Actually, we do *not* want to add these changes to the repository,
   so **let's  unstage them**.
    * Unstage the changes to `script.py` using the command:
      **`git restore --staged`**
    * Unstage the entire file `personal_notes.md`, using either
      **`git restore --staged`** or **`git rm --cached`**

      * :owl:
        **Reminder:** the difference between `git rm --cached` and `git restore --staged`
        is that `git rm --cached` **removes the entire file from the index**,
        while `git restore --staged` **reverts it to the version in the last
        commit** (`HEAD` commit).
      * :pushpin:
        **Note**: The reason why in this particular case `git rm --cached` does
        exactly the same as `git restore --staged ` is because
        `personal_notes.md` is a newly added file. There is thus no difference
        between removing it completely, or just resetting it back to its
        version from the latest commit (since it is absent from the latest
        commit).
      * :warning:
        Make sure *not* to run `git rm` instead of `git rm --cached`, as this
        would not only remove the file from the Git index, but also delete it
        from your working tree!

    * At this point, changes in `script.py` should again be unstaged, and
      `personal_notes.md` should be untracked.  
      Run **`git status`** to confirm this:
       ```txt
        Changes not staged for commit:
        	modified:   script.py

        Untracked files:
        	personal_notes.md
        ```
       <br>

2. **File staging shortcuts:** `git add --update` vs. `git add --all`.  

   :owl:
   **Reminder:**
   * **`git add --all`**: updates the Git index with
     **all modified and untracked files**.
   * **`git add --update`:** updates the Git index only with the new versions
     of files that are **already tracked**. It does *not* stage any new,
     untracked files. In a sense, `--update` is safer because it prevents you
     from adding completely new files to the Git repo by mistake.

   In the task just above, we have used `git add --all`. Now we would like to
   stage only the modified file `script.py`.
   * Run the command **`git add -u`**, then look at the status of your files.
     You should see that only `script.py` was staged (because it's a modified
     file), but not `personal_notes.md` (because it's untracked).
     ```sh
     git add -u   # -u is the shortcut for --update
     git status
     ```
     ```txt
      Changes to be committed:
        modified:   script.py

      Untracked files:
        personal_notes.md
     ```

   * Run `git restore --staged script.py` to unstage the changes to `script.py`.
   <br>

3. **Ignore a file using `.git/info/exclude`**.  
   `personal_notes.md` is a file that we never intend to track and share with
   other people. Therefore we would like to **ignore** it. However, since this
   file is specific to our own local setup, it should only be ignored by our
   local Git repo, and not by everyone else.

   :owl:
   **Reminder:** in Git, files/patterns to ignore only in your local repo
   should be added to **`.git/info/exclude`**. This is a text file that is
   automatically present in a `.git` repo.

    * Edit the file **`.git/info/exclude`** to ignore `personal_notes.md`.
      you can do this with a regular text editor, or using the following
      shell command:
      ```yaml
      echo "personal_notes.md" >> .git/info/exclude

      # Display the content of the file:
      cat .git/info/exclude
      ```
    * Run `git status` again. The file `personal_notes.md` should not longer
      be listed as *untracked*.  
      <br>

4. **Undo a changes from `script.py` in your working tree**.  
   If you run **`git diff`**, you will see that we currently have an
   uncommitted change in the `script.py` file:
     ```diff
     +adding a bad line...
     ```
   However, this is not a modification we want to keep. Instead, we would
   like to **reset the content of `script.py`** to its previous version
   (as in the Git index and the previous commit).

   * Using `git restore`, reset the content of `script.py` to its version in
     the Git index.
   * Run `cat script.py` to make sure the  "bad line" has been removed from the
     file.
   * Run `git diff`: there should be no difference anymore (no output).
   * Run `git status`: at this point, your working tree should be clean.
     ```txt
     On branch main
     nothing to commit, working tree clean
     ```

   :warning:
   As you have just experienced, `git restore <file>` really overwrites
   uncommitted modifications in your files. Use this command carefully to
   avoid losing work by mistake.
   <br>


5. **Remove a file from the repository**.  
   Currently the file `tests/output.csv` is being tracked in our Git repo.
   However, all things considered, this file is not really needed, and we now
   would like to delete it from both our repo and working tree.
   * Delete the file with **`git rm`**.
   * Run `git status`: you should see that the was was deleted, and that this
     deletion is already stage.
     ```txt
     On branch main
     Changes to be committed:
        deleted:    tests/output.csv
     ```
   * Make a new commit that removes this file from the repo. You can use the
     commit message `"Remove test output"`

   :owl:
   **Reminder:** while we have delete the file `output.csv` from the git index
   and the last commit, a copy of it still remains in the history of our
   repository.

6. **Retrieve `output.csv` from an older commit**.  
   Let's imagine that, for some reason, we want to retrieve the file
   `tests/output.csv` from our commit history.
   * Use command **`git restore --source <commit ref> tests/output.csv`**.
     You need to replace `<commit ref>` with the commit ID of the commit
     from where to retrieve the file.
   * :fire:
     **Tip:** you can use `HEAD~1` to refer to the second-to-last commit.

## Exercise 2 - The Git reference web page  [30 min].
**Objectives:** learn to use a basic branched workflow.

Well done! Your burgeoning Git skills have landed you a job as a junior
web-developer at Scamazone Inc., where you have been assigned the gratifying
task of fixing bugs in their website.

Let's get started:
1. Change directory into `/exercise_2`. You will see that it already contains
   a Git repository, as well as an HTML page named `references.html`.  
2. Open the `references.html` page in your web browser.
3. Explore the content of the Git repo using the `git log`, `git status` and
   `git branch` commands.

   :question:
   **questions:**  
    * How many commits have already been made in the repo?  
    * How many branches are present in the repo? How are they named?  
    * Are there any uncommitted changes?  

<br>

### A) Fix the broken "ProGit" link.
Your first task is to fix the broken link to the "ProGit" book in the HTML
page (currently when you click on the "ProGit" link in the page open in your
browser, it returns an error).

Since **we want to follow good practices**, we will *not* work on this fix in
the `main` branch. Instead we will create a new branch, fix the link problem on
that branch, test our fix, and then merge it into `main` once we are confident
the problem is solved.  
The reason we proceed in this way is because `main` is the branch that is used
to generate the "production" version of the Scamazone website (the version that
customers can see), and we don't want to make changes to that production
version until we are really sure that the changes we introduce in the code are
working as expected.

1. Before working on our fix in a new branch, we need to
   **make sure that our working tree is clean**:
    * Check the git repo to see if there are any uncommitted changes.
    * If there are, display the uncommitted changes to see what they do. Even
      if you are not familiar with HTML, it should be easy enough to figure-out
      what the changes do.
   <br>

2. Now that you have figured-out what the uncommitted changes do, stage the
   changes and **make a commit with a meaningful message**.  
   Verify that your working tree is now clean.

3. **Create a new branch named `fix`** and switch to it. This `fix` branch will
   be the "development branch" for our bug fix, the branch where we develop
   and test our bug fix so that changes in the code base remain isolated
   from the `main` branch.

4. On the new branch, edit the `references.html` file to fix the link to the
   "ProGit" book.  
   :dart:
   **Hint:** to fix the link, add `https://` in front of the URL.  

5. **Verify in your browser** that the link is now working properly (you might
   have to reload the page).  
   If it is the case, you can commit your changes.
   Please **use a meaningful commit message**.

6. Now that our bug fix is production ready, **merge the `fix` branch into `main`**,
   then run `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` (or the `git adog`
   command if you have created this alias). At this point, the output should
   look like this
   (commit ID values will differ and your commit messages may be different):
   ```
    * 50a2e7f (HEAD -> main, fix) Fix broken ProGit link
    * e6a6176 Add Git logo placeholder to the Git reference webpage
    * 8a7444c Add Git logo file
    * c99fb57 Add links to Git resources
    * 5b54605 First commit. Add template for the Git reference page
   ```

7. **Delete the `fix` branch** as it is no longer needed.  
   Run `git branch` and/or `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` to make
   sure the `fix` branch was deleted.  

Enjoy your Git reference page. You can have a look at the different links if
you want to learn everything about Git!

<br>

### B) Additional Tasks (if you have time): add an image and new links to the HTML page.

In this second part of the exercise, you are tasked to add a couple of new
links to books on the Git reference page.  
Here is what you should do:

1. Work in a **new branch** named `dev`.  

2. **Make a commit** that adds the following 2 references at the end of the list in
   the HTML page:  
   > `<li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/learn-git-in-a-month-of-lunches">Learn git in a month of lunches</a></li>`  
   > `<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Git-Porch-Willie-Crawford-2006-02-01/dp/B01K95YGYG">Git Porch</a></li>`

    * Use **`git diff`** and **`git diff --cached`** to look at your edits in
      the HTML file, before and after staging them.
    * :question:
      **Question:** what is the difference between `git diff` and
      `git diff --cached`?
    * Check whether you did a proper job by refreshing the HTML page in your
      browser *before* you commit your changes.  
   <br>

3. **Make a commit** that adds the Git logo to the webpage.
    * Replace the placeholder line that starts with `<!-- Add Git logo placeholder`
      by `<img src="git_logo.png">` in the HTML file.
    * :pushpin:
      **Note:** check whether you did a proper job by refreshing the HTML page
      in your browser *before* you commit your changes.

4. When you have added these new features - and tested that they actually work
   by reloading the `references.html` page in your browser (new links are
   working, logo was added) - merge your `dev` branch into `main`.

5. **Run `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`** to display your entire
   repository's history. It should look like this:  
   (commit ID values will differ and commit message may be different)
   ```
    * ba4687a (HEAD -> main, dev) Add git logo
    * 30b149a Add two new books to Git reference page
    * 50a2e7f Fix broken ProGit link
    * e6a6176 Add Git logo placeholder to the Git reference webpage
    * 8a7444c Add Git logo file
    * c99fb57 Add links to Git resources
    * 5b54605 First commit. Add template for the Git reference page
   ```

6. **Delete the `dev` branch**, you no longer need it.  
   Verify it was deleted by running `git branch` and/or
   `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`.


<br>
<br>
<br>


## Exercise 3 - The crazy peak sorter script [30 min]
**Objectives:** get familiar with rebasing branches, solving conflicts and
cherry-picking.

The stakes are raising! You are now taking the lead developer position of the
"peak sorter" project - a mesmerizing bash script that sorts all of the Alp's
4000 m summits in order of decreasing elevation (i.e. highest to lowest). It
also displays the name and elevation of the highest summit in the Alps when
completed.

* Start the exercise by changing your work directory to `exercise_3/` - it
  should be empty.
* Clone (download) the git repo for exercise 3 from GitHub with the command:
    ```yaml
    git clone https://github.com/sibgit/peak_sorter.git
    ```
  :owl:
  **Reminder:** the **`git clone`** command yet creates (downloads) a local
  copy of a Git repository from an online source (typically on GitHub or
  GitLab). It is probably the most common way of starting to work on a
  repository.
  <br>
* You should now have a new directory named "peak_sorter". Enter it with the
  command `cd peak_sorter`.
* To see the peak sorter script in action, run the following command in your
  shell:
    ```yaml
    ./peak_sorter.sh
    ```
* Have a look at the history of the git repo with
  `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` (or use the alias `git adog`,
  if you have created it).

<br>

### A) Add a fix to the `main` branch
Your first task is to add a data integrity check to the `peak_sorter.sh`
script. Luckily a former developer of the project, Jimmy, has already worked on
this issue and made a commit with the fix in his own branch named `dev-jimmy`.
The message of the commit containing the fix is:
> peak_sorter: add check that input table has the ALTITUDE and PEAK columns  

To apply this commit on the `main` branch of the `peak_sorter` script, proceed
as follows:

1. **Create a new `hotfix` branch** - we wouldn't want to work directly on
  `main`, would we?.

2. **Cherry-pick** the commit that contains Jimmy's fix onto your `hotfix`
   branch.

3. When the cherry-pick is completed, test run the `peak_sorter.sh` script to
   **make sure nothing was broken**:
    ```yaml
    ./peak_sorter.sh
    ```
   When running the script, you should now see an additional printed line
   informing you that a data integrity check was performed:
   > Running data integrity check...OK

   This shows us that the cherry-picked commit has indeed added the expected
   feature to our code.

   You can also have a look at the changes introduced by the cherry-pick with
   `git show HEAD` to review the last commit on the current branch.

4. When you are confident things are working as expected,
   **merge the `hotfix` branch into `main`**.

5. **Delete the `hotfix` branch**.

<br>

### B) Add the "Dahu count" feature to the `main` branch
Your next task is to add a new feature to the `peak_sorter.sh` script. This new
feature - which will take the peak sorter script to new heights - should add
the number of [Dahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahu) observations made on
each alpine peak to the output of the script.  

Again, you're in luck, because this feature has already been developed in a
branch of the Git repo. That branch is aptly named `feature-dahu`.  
Proceed as follows:  

1. **Checkout the `feature-dahu` branch** and test whether the new "Dahu count"
   feature has been implemented properly by running:
    ```yaml
   ./peak_sorter.sh
   ```
   :pushpin:
   **Note:** when switching to a branch that already exists on a remote,
   there is no need to add the `-c/--create` option to `git switch`. Here,
   this means that you can simply run `git switch feature-dahu` and Git will
   automatically create a local branch `feature-dahu` based on
   `origin/feature-dahu`.

   Verify that the script prints Dahu counts as part of its output. A column
   named `DAHU_POPULATION` should now also be present in the output file
   `sorted_peaks.txt`. You can have a look at this file with the command:
   ```yaml
   head sorted_peaks.txt
   ```

   To bring the Dahu count feature from the `feature-dahu` branch into the
   `main` branch, we will proceed in 2 steps: first we will rebase
   `feature-dahu` onto `main`, and then merge `feature-dahu` into `main`.  
   For now, let's display the **history of the git repo** with:
   `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` (i.e. `git adog`), so that we
   can compare it before and after the rebase that we will do at the next step.

2. **Rebase the `feature-dahu` branch on `main`**. This will result in
   conflicts that you have to manually resolve. In all 3 conflicts, always keep
   the version that is coming from the feature branch (it's the second version
   when you open the file to manually solve the conflicts - the version that is
   *not* coming from `HEAD`).

3. When you completed the rebase, run again:
    ```yaml
    ./peak_sorter.sh
    ```
   It should still display the number of Dahus observed on the Alps' highest
   peaks as it did before the rebase. And it should also display the data
   integrity check message `### Running data integrity check...OK` that
   we added to `main` earlier (because our `feature-dahu` branch now also
   contains the latest commits of `main`).

   Look again at your repo's history (`git adog`). Compare it to what you had
   before the merge (scroll up in your shell), to visually see how the rebase
   operation changed the history. Note how the hashes of the commits in the
   `feature-dahu` branch have changed.

4. When you are confident that the new Dahu count feature is correctly
   implemented, you can **merge `feature-dahu` into the `main` branch**.
    * :question:
      **Question:** do you expect any conflicts to occur during this merge?

At the end of the exercise, your history (`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`)
should look like this:  
(some commit ID values will differ)
```
* 02af2d4 (HEAD -> main, feature-dahu) peak_sorter: display highest peak at end of script
* 6d28329 peak_sorter: added authors as comment to script
* 249b8b4 peak_sorter: improved code commenting

```
<br>

:pushpin:
**Notes:**
 * In a real application, you would now push your changes on `main` to the
   remote repository on GitHub with the `git push` command. In this exercise
   however, you do not have the permissions on the remote repository to perform
   this action.
 * Trying to delete the local branch `feature-dahu` with the safe
   **`git branch -d`** option will not work, because changes on the branch
   have not been pushed to the upstream branch `origin/feature-dahu`.
   If you wanted to delete the `feature-dahu` branch, you would need to use the
   `-D` option to **force-delete** the branch: `git branch -D feature-dahu`.
 * If you wanted to push changes in `feature-dahu` to the remote, you would
   need to use `git push --force` to overwrite the branch's history on the
   remote. This is because **rebasing a branch modifies its history**: the
   history of the local and remote instance of the `feature-dahu` branch have
   now **diverged**.
 * To see this divergence in history, you can run
   `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` and look at the
   `feature-dahu` and `origin/feature-dahu` branches.

## Exercise 4 - The Awesome Animal Awareness Project [60 min]
**Objectives:** learn to collaborate with others on a project hosted on GitHub
or GitLab.

Congratulations! Your improving Git skills have not gone unnoticed, and you are
now hired by our agile startup to work on the
**Awesome Animal Awareness Project** !

Your mission - should you choose to accept it - is to help us build new
website. This is a **collaborative effort**, and you will be working in teams
of 3 people.
Each team will contribute a web page about a specific, and awesome, animal.
At the end of the exercise, the page created by your team will be integrated
into the [Awesome Animal Awareness website (GitHub)](https://sibgit.github.io)
or [Awesome Animal Awareness website (GitLab)](https://sib-git-training.gitlab.io/awesome-animal-awareness) -
use the GitHub or GitLab link, depending on whether the class is taught with
GitHub or GitLab.

* :fire:
  **Important:** please follow the **naming convention for branches** tightly,
  as our company's internal Git policies are **very strict**.
* :fire:
  **Before you start:** create a **personal access token (PAT)** on
  GitHub/GitLab.
  This will be needed in order to allow you to push changes to GitHub/GitLab.
  Please refer to the course slides for instructions on how to create the token
  (a demo might also be made in the class before the exercise).

### A) Organize your team
1. **Get together:** go to the
   [course's google doc page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EX72NInz-eA2d2GOa5aTB8D88GWb91Sk-sCNHwQYXqE)
   and check which team you belong to by looking at the **Team** column in the
   GitHub/GitLab user names table.
    * **On-site course:** locate your other team members in the classroom and
      sit together so you can communicate.
    * **Online course:** you will be placed in a breakout-room with your
      teammates. Remember that you can use the "share screen" function to
      help each other and show to other team members what you are doing on
      your machine.
   <br>

2. Change into `exercise_4/`, **clone the Awesome Animal Awareness project**,
   then **enter the cloned repo**. Here are the commands to do this:  
   :fire:
   **Important**: use the correct **GitHub** or **GitLab** repo, depending on
   whether the class is taught with GitHub or GitLab.

   * If working with **GitHub**:
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/sibgit/sibgit.github.io
      cd sibgit.github.io
      ```
   * If working with **GitLab**:
       ```sh
       git clone https://gitlab.com/sib-git-training/awesome-animal-awareness
       cd awesome-animal-awareness
       ```

3. **Among your group, chose a "team lead"**. The team lead should create a
   new **team branch** named after your animal's name followed by `-dev`.  
   Examples: `tiger-dev`, `yeti-dev`, `sunfish-dev`, `pallas-cat-dev`, ...  
   After the branch is created, the team leader should push it to the repo on
   GitHub/GitLab.

   :fire:
   **Important:** when you push a local branch to a remote *for the first time*,
   you have to indicate an "upstream" remote branch for the branch you are
   pushing.  
   This is done by using the `-u / --set-upstream` option of `git push`:
   ```yaml
   git push --set-upstream origin <branch you want to push>

   # Examples:
   git push --set-upstream origin sunfish-dev
   git push -u origin sunfish-dev  # -u is the shortcut for --set-upstream
   ```

4. Other team members can now **fetch changes** from the repo and
   **checkout the new team branch** branch that was just pushed by the team
   leader.
    * :fire:
      **Important:** other team members should *not* create the team branch
      locally themselves. They should check it out from the remote.
    * For other team members, the `-u / --set-upstream` option is *not* needed
      when they push changes to the team branch for the first time, because the
      upstream was automatically set by Git when checking-out the team branch
      from the remote.
   <br>

5. Each team member should now **create a personal branch**, using the
   following naming scheme:
   `<animal>-<your name>`, e.g. `tiger-sandra` or `pallas-cat-tom`. Note that
   this branch does not necessarily have to be pushed to the remote: it's your
   personal work branch, so it can stay local.

   :pushpin:
   **Note:** in a real application, you would probably want to push your
   personal branch to the remote as a backup (depending on how long-lived your
   branch is), but this is not necessary for this exercise.

<br>


### B) Add content for your awesome animal

Each team member will now contribute something to the web page of the team's
animal.  

1. Switch to your **personal branch**.

2. On your personal branch, **edit the HTML file corresponding to your animal**.
   The topics that each member of the team has to work on are listed in the
   Google doc - see the **Task** column of the table.
   In the HTML file, the `??` mark the positions where you have to add your
   content (make sure to remove the `??` after you are done editing).
   * For the team member with the task "Animal name", make sure to include the
     [binomial name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature) of
     the species as well, e.g. "Pallas's cat (*Otocolobus manul*)"
   * For the team member with the **task "Picture"**, you can either:
     * Link an existing image from somewhere on the web by setting
       `<img src=https://...>`.
     * Find and download a picture of your animal from the web, add the image
       to the project repo (at the root of the project directory), and insert
       the file name into `<img src="?? image-filename">`,
       e.g. `<img src="tiger_image.png">`.  
       :fire:
       **Important:** make sure to add the image file to your commit.

3. **Check the rendering of your HTML file** by opening it with your browser.

4. **Commit your changes** with a meaningful message.  

<br>


### C) Merge your branch with your team's animal-dev branch
Each team member should now merge the edits made on their personal branch (e.g.
`tiger-sandra`) into the team's main development branch (e.g. `tiger-dev`), and
then push the changes back to the remote repo on GitHub/GitLab.

This is **best done as a coordinated, iterative, process**, where each member
will in turn:

1. **Do a `git pull`** on the team's main development branch to make sure their
   local copy is up-to-date.  
   :fire:
   **Important:** verify that you are on the correct branch before running
   `git pull`.  
   :pushpin:
   **Note:** in situations where you are not sure whether a remote branch has
   diverged from your local copy, you can do a `git fetch` + `git status`
   before running `git pull`. In this way you will see whether the merge
   that will be done by `git pull` will be fast-forward or not.
   :owl:
   Reminder: `git pull` is a shortcut for `git fetch` + `git merge <upstream>`.

2. **Rebase their personal branch** on the team's main development branch. Note
   that the first person to add their changes will in principle *not* need to
   rebase, since their personal branch will already be rooted at the latest
   commit of the team's main development branch.

3. **Merge the changes** from their personal branch into the team's main
   development branch.

4. **Push the changes** back to the remote repo on GitHub/GitLab. Then let the
   next team member know that they can proceed.

<br>

After all team members have gone through the above steps, the team's main
development branch should contain the work of all 3 team members.

<br>

### D) Create a pull request / merge request for the top-level management to verify and approve your work.
Now that your team's main branch is all merged and clean, the team leader
should **create a pull request** (or a **merge request** if using GitLab) for
the team branch to be merged into the project's `main` branch.

1. Creating a pull request (merge request) is done online, in the project's
   [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sibgit/sibgit.github.io) or
   [GitLab repository](https://github.com/sibgit/sibgit.github.io).
   In the **Pull requests** / **Merge requests** tab, click on
   **New pull request** / **New Merge request**.
   For more details on how to create a pull request / merge request, please
   refer to the course slides.

2. Once the management approved your work and merged it into `main`, you should
   be able to see your animal's page on the
   [Awesome Animal Awareness website (GitHub)](https://sibgit.github.io) or
   [Awesome Animal Awareness website (GitLab)](https://gitlab.com/sib-git-training/awesome-animal-awareness)!

Well done! Enjoy your success by reading about your awesome animal and
looking-up some of the other teams' pages.

<br>

### E) Additional Tasks (if you have time): branch cleanup
After your team branch has been merged into the `main` branch of the project,
you can now delete your team branch and personal branches (since they have been
merged).

1. Each team member can delete their personal branch and team branch from their
   local repo.
2. One person in the team can delete the team branch on the remote. The command
   for this is:
    ```yaml
    git push origin --delete <branch name>
    ```
3. Each team member can then update their local copy of the `main` branch.
    ```yaml
    git fetch --prune
    git switch main
    git pull
    ```

  :pushpin:  
  **Note:** the **`--prune`** option in `git fetch --prune`
  **removes references to remote branches** (i.e. remote-tracking references)
  that no longer exist on the remote. For instance, if a team branch was
  deleted on the remote (after it was merged into `main`), then you will
  probably also want to delete your local reference to this remote branch from
  your local copy of the repo.  
  The `--prune` option can also be passed to `git pull`: `git pull --prune`.
