		<h1>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</h1>

		<img src="platypus.jpg">

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Platypus are found in eastern Australia from the steamy tropics of far north Queensland to the freezing snows of Tasmania.
			In Queensland, platypus live in rivers east of the Great Dividing Range, and are also found in some western-flowing streams. In north Queensland, the range of the platypus is close to the coast. The animals aren't found in Cape York Peninsula.
			Platypus make their home in and near freshwater creeks, slow-moving rivers, lakes joined by rivers, and built water storages such as farm dams.
			They build a simple burrow in a river bank, just above water level and often among a tangle of tree roots.

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Platypuses are mostly nocturnal. During the day they sleep in the chambers at the end of riverbank burrows.
			At dusk they emerge to search the river bottom for food, sometimes hunting for 10 to 12 hours a night.

			Theyâ€™re compltely carnivorous (meat-eating) and mstly eat invertebrates: 
			swimming beetles and waterbugs, insect larvae, tadpoles, worms, snails and shrimp.

			They scoop up gravel and dirt along with their prey, store it in their cheek-pouches, 
			and bring it all to the surface to eat.

		<h3>It has a very funny shape, half duck half something else</h3>
		<p>
			Platypuses are one of the only my mammals that lay eggs!
