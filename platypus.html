		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Platypuses are mostly nocturnal. During the day they sleep in the chambers at the end of riverbank burrows.
			At dusk they emerge to search the river bottom for food, sometimes hunting for 10 to 12 hours a night.

			Theyâ€™re compltely carnivorous (meat-eating) and mstly eat invertebrates: 
			swimming beetles and waterbugs, insect larvae, tadpoles, worms, snails and shrimp.

			They scoop up gravel and dirt along with their prey, store it in their cheek-pouches, 
			and bring it all to the surface to eat.

		<h3>It has a very funny shape, half duck half something else</h3>

			Platypuses are one of the only my mammals that lay eggs!
