		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
                The platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of Tasmania and the Australian Alps to the tropical rainforests of coastal Queensland as far north as the base of the Cape York Peninsula.
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Platypus eat small water animals such as insect larvae, freshwater shrimps, and crayfish. The platypus, usually active at dawn and dusk, relies on its sensitive bill to find food.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>

			?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's behaviour.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
                <p>I like that it stumped the people who discovered it.</p>
