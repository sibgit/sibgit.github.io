		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Arctic, Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from the tropics to the drift ice of polar waters.	
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>

			?? Eats krill.
		</p>

		<h3>Behavior</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales are migrators: they spend summers feeding in polar waters and as
			winter arrives they migrate towards the equatorial water.
			Thy swim at about 5 miles an hour but they can be as fast as 20 miles per hour if needed
			(but only for a short time).

			It is blue.

			It is a huge and great animal
			<br>
			They are full of grace.
