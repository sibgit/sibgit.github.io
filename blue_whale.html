		<h1>Blue whale (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>)</h1>

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales live in all the world's oceans, except the Arctic, occasionally swimming in small groups but usually alone or in pairs.
			They often spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			The blue whale's diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (krill). Blue whales have been observed near Magdalena Bay (along the western coast of Baja California, Mexico) feeding on pelagic red crabs. However, recent observations or fecal samples have not confirmed this. Other accidental or opportunistic consumption of copepods and amphipods have been documented. Blue whales feed on krill at the surface and depths greater than 100 metres (328 ft), following their prey's diel (24 hour) vertical migration through the water column.

			Blue whales capture krill through lunge feeding, a bulk filter-feeding strategy that involves accelerating toward a prey patch at high speeds, opening the mouth 80–90°,and inverting the tongue, creating a large sac. This allows them to engulf a large volume of krill-laden water, up to 220 tonnes (220 long tons; 240 short tons) of water at one time. They squeeze the water out through their baleen plates with pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue, and they swallow the remaining krill. Blue whales have been recorded making 180° rolls during lunge-feeding, allowing them to engulf krill patches while inverted. They rolled while searching for prey between lunges, which has been hypothesized as allowing them to process the prey field visually to find the densest prey patches.

			The Eastern North Pacific population of blue whales has been well studied. The greatest dive depth reported from tagged blue whales was 315 metres (1,033 ft). Their theoretical aerobic dive limit was estimated at 31.2 minutes, however, the longest dive duration measured was 15.2 minutes. The deepest confirmed dive from a pygmy blue whale was 510 metres (1,660 ft).

			Blue whales maximize the intake of energy by increasing the number of lunges they make during a dive while targeting dense krill patches. This allows them to acquire the energy necessary for sustaining basic metabolic maintenance costs while storing additional energy necessary for migration and reproduction. Because of the high cost of lunge feeding, it has been estimated that blue whales must target densities greater than 100 krill/m3. They can consume 34,776–1,912,680 kilojoules (8,312–457,141 kcal) from one mouthful of krill, which can provide up to 240 times more energy than used in a single lunge. Energetic models have estimated the daily prey biomass requirement for an average-sized blue whale is 1,120 ± 359 kilograms (2,469 ± 791 lb) krill. Blue whales may accidentally eat small fish that are in the swarms of krill (although this is rare).

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h1>

			 It’s big and swims…
			 The blue whale is the largest known animal to have ever existed!
