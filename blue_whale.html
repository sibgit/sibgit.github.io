		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			
The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, known for its solitary or small group behavior. They communicate using low-frequency calls, often traveling great 
distances to find mates or feeding grounds. Blue whales primarily feed by filter-feeding on krill, consuming up to 4 tons a day during feeding season.
