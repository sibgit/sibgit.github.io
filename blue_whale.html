        <h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
        <p>
            Blue whales are found in all the world's oceans, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. They prefer deep ocean waters and are often found in areas with abundant food supply, such as near upwelling zones and continental shelves.

        <h3>Diet / behavior / social organization</h3>
        <p>
            Blue whales primarily feed on small shrimp-like animals called krill. They are filter feeders, using their baleen plates to strain large volumes of water and capture their prey. Blue whales are generally solitary animals, but they can be found in small groups, especially during feeding or breeding seasons. Their social structure is not well understood, but they are known to communicate using low-frequency vocalizations that can travel long distances underwater. You can expand on diet, behavior,
            or social organization. Select whatever topic seems the most
            relevant for your animal.

        <h3>What makes this animal awesome</h3>
        <p>
            Blue whales are the largest animals known to have ever existed on Earth. Their sheer size and grace in the water are awe-inspiring. Additionally, their ability to communicate over vast distances using low-frequency sounds is fascinating and highlights the complexity of their social interactions.
