		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in certain areas might not migrate at all.
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's diet.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales sometimes swim in small groups but are more often found alone or in pairs. They generally spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the equatorial waters as winter arrives.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			Their intelligence is fascinating! They are excellent communicators, and they show high levels of emotional and social intelligence
