		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in certain areas might not migrate at all.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			The blue whale's diet consists almost exclusively of krill.[11] Blue whales capture krill through lunge feeding, they swim towards them at high speeds as they open their mouths up to 80°[11][63] They may engulf 220 metric tons (220 long tons; 240 short tons) of water at one time.[67] They squeeze the water out through their baleen plates with pressure from the throat pouch and tongue, and swallow the remaining krill.[11][63] Blue whales have been recorded making 180° rolls during lunge-feeding, possibly allowing them to search the prey field and find the densest patches.

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales sometimes swim in small groups but are more often found alone or in pairs. They generally spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the equatorial waters as winter arrives.

			Their intelligence is fascinating! They are excellent communicators, and they show high levels of emotional and social intelligence
