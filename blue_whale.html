		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The five blue whale subspecies recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy’s Committee on Taxonomy are distributed in all major ocean basins, except the Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean, although blue whales have been sighted near the ice edge in the North Atlantic.
			The distributions of the five subspecies of blue whale are outlined below. Some of these blue whale subspecies have been further divided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service, resulting in at least nine recognized management units, based largely on unique song types.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			The primary and preferred diet of blue whales is krill—tiny shrimp-like animals. Fish and copepods (tiny crustaceans) may occasionally be part of the blue whale’s diet. When blue whales hunt for food, they filter feed by swimming toward large schools of krill with their mouth open, then push the water out of their mouth with their tongue while keeping the krill trapped inside their baleen plates.

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales - in spite of their impressive size - travel on average more than 100 km per day. This optimizes access to prey in the spring and summer, reduce calf predation from orcas, and optimize thermoregulation for growth in the winter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale#Behavior).

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			Blue whales are amazing creatures. The largest animals that live on Earth, blue whales can grow to over 30m long and weigh more than 130,000kg – that’s longer than three buses and heavier than three lorries! Besides, blue whales make a series of super-loud vocal sounds. Their calls are the loudest of any creature on the planet, in fact, and can be heard underwater for hundreds of kilometres.
