		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The Cross River gorilla, like many other gorilla subspecies, prefer a dense forest habitat that is uninhabited by humans. Due to the Cross River gorillaâ€™s body size they require large and diverse areas of the forest to meet their habitat requirements. Similar to most endangered primates, their natural habitat exists where humans are often occupying and using for natural resources. Forests that are inhabited by the Cross River gorilla vary in altitude from approximately 100 to 2,037 metres (328 to 6,683 ft) above sea level.[12] Between 1996 and 1999, Field work was conducted on Afi Mountain in Cross River State, Nigeria for a period of 32 months..

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			A study published in 2007 in the American Journal of Primatology announced the discovery of the subspecies fighting back against possible threats from humans.[17] They "found several instances of gorillas throwing sticks and clumps of grass".[18] This is unusual.[19] When encountered by humans, gorillas usually flee and rarely charge..
