		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Gorillas have a patchy distribution. The range of the two species is separated by the Congo River and its tributaries. The western gorilla lives in west central Africa, while the eastern gorilla lives in east central Africa. Between the species, and even within the species, gorillas live in a variety of habitats and elevations. Gorilla habitat ranges from montane forest to swampland. Eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forest between 650 and 4,000 m (2,130 and 13,120 ft) above sea level.[31] Mountain gorillas live in montane forest at the higher end of the elevation range, while eastern lowland gorillas live in submontane forest at the lower end. In addition, eastern lowland gorillas live in montane bamboo forest, as well as lowland forest ranging from 600–3,308 m (1,969–10,853 ft) in elevation.[32] Western gorillas live in both lowland swamp forest and montane forest, at elevations ranging from sea level to 1,600 m (5,200 ft).[31] Western lowland gorillas live in swamp and lowland forest ranging up to 1,600 m (5,200 ft), and Cross River gorillas live in low-lying and submontane forest ranging from 150–1,600 m (490–5,250 ft).n
