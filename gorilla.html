		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's habitat and distribution.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Gorillas stick to a mainly vegetarian diet, feeding on stems, bamboo shoots and fruits. Western lowland gorillas, however, also have an appetite for termites and ants, and break open termite nests to eat the larvae.
