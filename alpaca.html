		Alpacas can be found throughout most of South America. They typically live in temperate conditions in the mountains with high altitudes.

		They are easy to care for since they are not limited to a specific type of environment. Animals such as flamingos, condors, spectacled bears, mountain lions, coyotes, llamas, and sheep live near alpacas when they are in their natural habitat.

		<p>
		Alpacas are native to Peru, but can be found throughout the globe in captivity.
