		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
		Alpacas can be found throughout most of South America. They typically live in temperate conditions in the mountains with high altitudes.
		<br/>
		They are easy to care for since they are not limited to a specific type of environment. Animals such as flamingos, condors, spectacled bears, mountain lions, coyotes, llamas, and sheep live near alpacas when they are in their natural habitat.		
		</p>	
		<p>
		Alpacas are native to Peru, but can be found throughout the globe in captivity.
		</p>
		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Pasture grass, hay, silage.
		</p>	

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
        Alpacas are very social creatures. They are gentle and curious and with training can become great pets, according to Switzer. Herds often include animals of different species or taxonomic families, such as llamas, goats and sheep, according to the FAO.

Alpacas spit when they are distressed or feel threatened. They will sometimes spit at each other when they are competing for food or trying to establish dominance, according to Switzer. They won't spit at people or bite unless they have been abused.

Alpacas hum; they make a sound like "mmm," according to Alpaca Ventures. However, they also shriek when danger is present, and make a sound similar to a "wark" noise when excited. Fighting males scream, making a warbling bird-like cry.

Alpacas in a herd all use the same area as a bathroom instead of defecating in random areas like many animals do. This behavior helps control parasites, according to the FAO. Males often have cleaner dung piles than females, according to Alpaca Ventures. Females tend to stand in a line and all go at once.
