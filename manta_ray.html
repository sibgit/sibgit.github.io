        <h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
        <p>
            Mantas are pelagic species found in tropical and subtropical waters
            of all of the world's major oceans. They also venture into
            temperate seas.
            <br>
            The furthest from the equator that mantas have been recorded is
            North Carolina in the United States (31°N) and the North Island of
            New Zealand (36°S).
            <br>
            Manta rays prefer water temperatures above 20 °C.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>M. alfredi</em> is mainly found in tropical areas.
            <br>
            <em>M. birostris</em> lives mostly in the open ocean,
            travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where
            upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase prey concentrations.
