		<h1>Manta ray (<em>Mobula sp.</em>)</h1>

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Mantas are pelagic species found in tropical and subtropical waters in
			all the world's major oceans, and also venture into temperate seas.
			<br>
			The furthest from the equator they have been recorded is North Carolina
			in the United States (31°N) and the North Island of New Zealand (36°S).
			<br>
			Manta rays prefer water temperatures above 20 °C.
			<ul>
				<li> <em>M. alfredi</em> is minantly found in tropical areas.
				<li> <em>M. birostris</em> lives mostly in the open ocean,
				     travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where
				     upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase prey concentrations.
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Manta rays are filter feeders as well as macropredators.
                        <br>
                        On the surface, they consume large quantities of zooplankton in the
                        form of shrimp, krill, and planktonic crabs.
                        <br>
                        In deeper depths, mantas consume small to medium-sized fish.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Swimming behavior in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over
			deep water, they swim at a constant rate in a straight line, while further
			inshore, they usually bask or swim idly around.
			<br>
			Mantas may travel alone or in groups up to 50. They may associate with other
			fish species, as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes
			breach or leap out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial
			jumps in succession.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li> It glides gracefully thourgh the sea, like an aquatic bird.
				<li> Unlike its shark relatives, it does not have sharp teeth.
			</ul>
