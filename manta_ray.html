        <h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
        <p>
            Mantas are pelagic species found in tropical and subtropical waters
            of all of the world's major oceans. They also venture into
            temperate seas.
            <br>
            The furthest from the equator that mantas have been recorded is
            North Carolina in the United States (31°N) and the North Island of
            New Zealand (36°S).
            <br>
            Manta rays prefer water temperatures above 20 °C.
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>M. alfredi</em> is mainly found in tropical areas.
            <br>
            <em>M. birostris</em> lives mostly in the open ocean,
            travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where
            upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase prey concentrations.
        </p>

        <h3>Diet / behavior / social organization</h3>
        <p>
            Manta rays are filter feeders as well as macro-predators.
            <br>
            On the surface, they consume large quantities of zooplankton in the
            form of shrimp, krill, and planktonic crabs.
            <br>
            At deeper depths, mantas consume small to medium-sized fish.
            <br>
            <br>
            Swimming behavior in mantas differs across habitats: when
            travelling over deep water, they swim at a constant rate in a
            straight line, while further inshore, they usually bask or swim
            idly around.
            <br>
            Mantas may travel alone or in groups up to 50. They may associate
            with other fish species, as well as sea birds and marine mammals.
            Mantas sometimes breach or leap out of the water. Individuals in a
            group may make aerial jumps in succession.

        <h3>What makes this animal awesome</h3>
        <p>
            It glides gracefully through the sea, like an aquatic bird.
