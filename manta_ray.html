		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Mantas are found in tropical and subtropical waters in all the world's major oceans,
			and also venture into temperate seas.
			<br>
			The furthest from the equator they have been recorded is North Carolina in the
			United States, and the North Island of New Zealand.
			<br>
			They prefer water temperatures above 68 °F (20 °C)
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Manta rays are filter feeders as well as macropredators. On the surface, they consume
			large quantities of zooplankton in the form of shrimp, krill, and planktonic crabs.
			In deeper depths, mantas consume small to medium-sized fish.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Mantas visit cleaning stations on coral reefs for the removal of external parasites.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			Their effortless and elegant swimming !
