		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Mantas are pelagic species found in tropical and subtropical waters in
			all the world's major oceans, and also venture into temperate seas.
			<br>
			The furthest from the equator they have been recorded is North Carolina
			in the United States (31°N) and the North Island of New Zealand (36°S).
			<br>
			Manta rays prefer water temperatures above 20 °C.
			<ul>
				<li> <em>M. alfredi</em> is minantly found in tropical areas.
				<li> <em>M. birostris</em> lives mostly in the open ocean,
				     travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where
				     upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase prey concentrations.
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Manta rays are filter feeders as well as macropredators.
                        <br>
                        On the surface, they consume large quantities of zooplankton in the
                        form of shrimp, krill, and planktonic crabs.
                        <br>
                        In deeper depths, mantas consume small to medium-sized fish.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's behaviour.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li> It glides gracefully thourgh the sea, like an aquatic bird.
				<li> Unlike its shark relatives, it does not have sharp teeth.
			</ul>
		</p>
