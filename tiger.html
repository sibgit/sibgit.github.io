		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Tigers live in diverse habitats including tropical rainforests, grasslands, and temperate forests, depending on the subspecies. They prefer areas with dense vegetation, water sources, and abundant prey. Conservation efforts are critical as their habitats shrink due to human activities. Tigers are primarily found in South and Southeast Asia, including India, Bangladesh, and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. Smaller populations exist in eastern Russia (Siberia) and China. They inhabit diverse regions like forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps, with India hosting the largest population.
