Habitat
Capybaras are semi-aquatic mammals, so their lifestyle is entirely dependent on a nearby source of permanent water.

Key Requirement: They live in areas with a reliable water source, such as rivers, lakes, ponds, marshes, and swamps.

Environment: They thrive in densely vegetated areas close to this water. This includes flooded grasslands, savannas, and forested riverbanks.

Daily Use: They use the water to escape from predators, to cool off in the heat, and for mating. While they graze on land, they never stray far from the water's edge. They sleep in dense vegetation on the ground, not in burrows.
