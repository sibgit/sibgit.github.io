        <h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
        <p>Capybaras are native to South America and can also be found in southern Central America (Panama). You can find them in countries such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brazil</li>
            <li>Argentina (northern)</li>
            <li>Paraguay</li>
            <li>Uruguay</li>
            <li>Venezuela</li>
            <li>Colombia</li>
            <li>Peru</li>
            <li>Guyana</li>
            <li>Suriname</li>
            <li>French Guiana</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Habitat Details</h4>
        <p>Capybaras are semi-aquatic mammals, so their lifestyle is entirely dependent on a nearby source of permanent water.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Requirement:</strong> They live in areas with a reliable water source, such as rivers, lakes, ponds, marshes, and swamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> They thrive in densely vegetated areas close to this water. This includes flooded grasslands, savannas, and forested riverbanks.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Use:</strong> They use the water to escape from predators, to cool off in the heat, and for mating. While they graze on land, they never stray far from the water's edge. They sleep in dense vegetation on the ground, not in burrows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Diet / behavior / social organization</h3>
        <p>
            Like many other rodents, capybaras are vegetarian and their diet consists of plants mostly. They can chew on hard things such as barks too as their jaws are very strong. Capybarasâ€™ diet mostly consists of plants, grasses and leaves. They also like fruits and berries. Their diet is generally low in protein and high in fiber.
        </p>

        <h3>What makes this animal awesome</h3>
        <p>
            They are famously calm and chill. Capybaras have a "zen-like" reputation. They are incredibly placid, gentle, and seem unbothered by almost anything.
