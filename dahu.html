		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			There are two types of Dahu : the "Dextro" and the "Levo", depending on the legs'sizes. It runs around the mountain, always in the same direction. It can not turn back. That makes it easy to catch. Juts go behindit and call it. Whenit turns, it falls.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			It lives in Valais, soprobably likes to drink wine together with the grass :-)
