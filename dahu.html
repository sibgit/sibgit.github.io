		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
		The Dahu is endemic to Valais. It lives in the mountain flanks and need a minimum 15% slope to be able to walk
		</p>

		<h3> Diet </h3>
		<p>
			The diet of the Dahu involves indigenous plants, roots and herbs of the Valais region of Switzerland. Without the local flora, the Dahu will perish.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			There are two types of Dahu : the "Dextro" and the "Levo", depending on the legs'sizes. It runs around the mountain, always in the same direction. It can not turn back. That makes it easy to catch. Juts go behind it and call it. When it turns, it falls.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			It lives in Valais, so probably likes to drink wine together with the grass :-)
