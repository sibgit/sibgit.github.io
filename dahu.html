		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The dahu is a legendary creature that resembles a mountain goat and is well known in France and francophone regions of 
			Switzerland and Italy, including the Aosta Valley. The dahu, a quadrupedal mammal, may have been inspired by the chamois, 
			a small, horned goat-antelope once plentiful in European mountainous regions, and also resembles the ibex.

			Regional variations on its name include dahut or dairi in Jura, darou in Vosges, daru in Picardy, darhut in Burgundy, da√π in Val Camonica; also 
			called a tamarou in Aubrac and Aveyron, and tamarro in Catalonia and Andorra. The dahu cub is called a dahuot.
