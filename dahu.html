        <h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
        <p>
            ?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's habitat
            and distribution.

        <h3>Diet / behavior / social organization</h3>
         <h4>Dietary Behavior: The Gourmet of the Mountains</h2>
    <p>
        The Dahu is a creature of <strong>culinary contradiction</strong>, its diet as asymmetrical as its legendary legs. Observations (or at least, tavern tales) suggest a diet that is both highly specialized and absurdly opportunistic:
   
        Vertical Grazing: Due to its famously uneven legs, the Dahu is perfectly adapted to grazing on steep Alpine slopes, favoring edelweiss petals and moss from north-facing rocks.
        Seasonal Feasting: In winter, it survives on snow-fermented lichen and the dreams of lost hikers.
        Symbiotic Snacking The Dahu spreads seeds in its wake, but only those of plants that grow at a 45-degree angle.
	</p>
    <h4>Social Organization: The Hierarchy of the Heights</h4>
    <p>
        Dahu society is as <strong>labyrinthine</strong> as the mountain paths they tread. Their social structure is built on three pillars: asymmetry, secrecy, and the occasional prank.


        Asymmetrical Monarchy: Ruled by a Grand Dahu, leadership is determined by who can stand on a flat rock the longest without toppling.
        Left-Leaning and Right-Leaning Factions: Dahu society is divided into clans based on which side of the mountain they prefer.
        Council of Echoes: Major decisions are made by a council of elders who communicate via echoes bounced between valleys.
    </p>

    <h4>Cultural Quirks</h4>
    <p>
        The Dahu is known to steal socks from laundry lines and leave wind chimes made from goat bells as offerings to the mountain spirits. Their philosophy: <em>"What goes up must come down—unless you’re clever."</em>

	<h4>What makes this animal awesome</h4>
        <p>
        The Dahu is more than a myth. It is a mirror of Alpine resilience and whimsy. Its dietary quirks remind us that survival can be an art, and its social structures reflect the delicate balance of community and individuality. In a world where symmetry is overrated, the Dahu thrives as a symbol of adaptation, humor, and the joy of defying expectations.
