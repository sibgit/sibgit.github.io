		<h1>White shark</h1>

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			White shark habitats are generally restricted to water, preferably warmer waters. They are often solitary animals, but have been known to hunt in packs.
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			According to my very in-depth Google search, their diet is earless seals.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			This animal is <b>really</b> well behaved, except when it gives overly-aggressive hugs to surfers. 
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			I like that this animal can breathe underwater, that's really neat.
