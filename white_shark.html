		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The great white shark is usually found in Australia and South Africa but they change their habitat based on their age. The young ones can be found near the coasts while as they get older, they tend to move further towards the ocean.
			The grear white shark is distributed in many parts of the world such as in the Mediterrenean , South Africa, parts of Australia and New Zealand. Some can be found near California in the United States and also in the North Atlantic.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			I like how this majestic animal is closely related to the pre historic megalodon.
			Its breaching behaviour to hunt seals for food is also fascinating.
