		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The great white shark is usually found in Australia and South Africa but they change their habitat based on their age. The young ones can be found near the coasts while as they get older, they tend to move further towards the ocean.
			The grear white shark is distributed in many parts of the world such as in the Mediterrenean , South Africa, parts of Australia and New Zealand. Some can be found near California in the United States and also in the North Atlantic.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			A marine carnivore, generally prefers to eat animals like seals, fish, sea turtles etc.  
		Great white sharks are carnivorous and prey upon fish (e.g. tuna, rays, other sharks),[110] cetaceans (i.e., dolphins, porpoises, whales), pinnipeds (e.g. seals, fur seals,[110] and sea lions), squid, sea turtles,[110] sea otters (Enhydra lutris) and seabirds.[114][115] Great whites have also been known to eat objects that they are unable to digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish, including other elasmobranchs, as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of 3 m (9.8 ft) or more, at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species.[116] Upon approaching a length of nearly 4 m (13 ft), great white sharks begin to target predominantly marine mammals for food, though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences.[117][118] They seem to be highly opportunistic.[119][120] These sharks prefer prey with a high content of energy-rich fat. Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal, a pig, and a sheep from his boat in the South Farallons. The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.[121]

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's behaviour.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>

			I like how this majestic animal is closely related to the pre historic megalodon.
			Its breaching behaviour to hunt seals for food is also fascinating.

			I like the fact that they are the biggest marine carnivorous fish and yet have their own predators. 
		I like that this animal is a top predator that keeps the ecosystem in balance.
