**About "Additional Tasks"**  
As you will see, some of the exercises contain an **Additional Tasks** section.
These are tasks that you can do if you have completed the regular part of the
exercise but there is still time in the exercise session. Additional Tasks will
not be corrected in class, but you can find corrections for them in the
exercise solutions.

<br>
<br>

## Exercise 1 - The vim cheat-sheet rebase  [40 min]
**Objective:** learn to use **interactive rebase**.

In this exercise, your task is to perform a cleanup on an existing repository
that contains instructions on how to use the `vim` editor.

:fire:
**Important:** in this exercise we will be **rewriting history on the `main` branch**
of our repository. In a *production* environment, this
**should in principle be avoided**.

Proceed as follows:

1. Enter the `exercise_1/vim_cheatsheet.git` repository and have a look at it's
   history. If you are using `vim` as an editor in Git, you can have a look at
   the content of the files to learn about some useful `vim` commands.  
   Switch to the `dev` branch, and look which files it contains. Then go back
   to the `main` branch.

2. Looking at the **commit history** on the `main` branch, you will see that
   the edits to the different files are all over the place. To make things more
   tidy, we first would like to group (in the history's chronology) the edits
   to each of the 3 files: `README.md`, `normal_mode.md` and `command_mode.md`.

   Your first task is thus to **re-order the commits on the `main` branch** in
   the following order (here listed from oldest to newest):
   ```
    1. First commit of the vim cheat-sheet project. Add README file
    2. Edit README file
    3. Edit README file: add open file example
    4. Add 'normal_mode' file: commands for vim's normal mode
    5. Edit 'normal_mode' file: add 'dd' and 'yy' commands
    6. Edit 'normal_mode' file: add more commands
    7. Add 'command_mode' file: commands for vim's command mode
    8. Edit 'command_mode' file: add more commands
   ```
   <br>

3. **After you are done with the re-ordering**, display the history of the repo
   using `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` (or `git adog`, if you
   created this alias).
   You should see that branch `dev` still contains the two "old" commits
   (`8ec5c65` and `eb8d137`) from the shared history it had with the `main`
   branch before the rebase. These two commits are now duplicated between the
   two branches. To get rid of them, rebase `dev` on `main`, then return to
   `main`.

   :pushpin:
   **Note:** after the rebase completed, you should observe that Git
   **automatically skipped the duplicated commits** on `dev`, because they have
   the exact same content as their counterparts on `main`.

   <br>

4. All things considered, our repo history would look cleaner if, for each
   file, we had a **single commit** rather than having multiple small and
   incremental commits.  
    * **For each file, merge the different commits** so that your history looks
      like what is shown below (the oldest commit is listed at the bottom).
    * **Change** the commit message of the commit adding the README file to:
      `README: add vim modes and open file example`.
       ```
        * Add 'command_mode' file: commands for vim's command mode
        * Add 'normal_mode' file: commands for vim's normal mode
        * README: add vim modes and open file example
        * First commit of the vim cheat-sheet project. Add README file
       ```

   :fire:
   **Important:** the commit message for the second commit is a new message.
   You will need to **edit the commit message during the rebase**.  
   :pushpin:
   **Note:** the `README.md` file still has 2 commits - because its first
   commit is also the first commit of the repo (and that first commit is more
   difficult - but not impossible - to change).

   <br>

5. Display the history of the repo using
   `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`. You will see that, again,
   **`dev` and `main` have diverged** with **duplicated commits**. At this
   point, please temporarily save the hash of the commit to which `dev` is
   currently pointing - you will need shortly.

   To get rid of the duplicated commits, we need to rebase `dev` on `main`.
   However, in this case, a regular rebase will *not* be able to automatically
   remove the duplicated commits (because they no longer exactly match).
   Instead, a regular rebase would raise conflicts that you would then have
   to manually resolve.  
   Since we know which commits are duplicated (all except the last 2 commits
   of `dev`), the **better approach here is to use interactive rebase** and
   manually instruct Git to drop the duplicated commits.  
   :pushpin:
   **Note:** an alternative approach would be to run `git rebase --skip` each
   time there is a conflict, to tell Git to skip the conflicting commit.

   **To make sure that no changes were lost during your rebase**, run a
   `git diff` between the commit of `dev` before the rebase (the hash you were
   asked to temporarily save earlier) and the current version of `dev`.
   If the rebase was done properly, **the diff should not yield any difference**.

   <br>

6. **Switch back to the `main` branch**. At this point, the history of your
   repo (`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`) should look like this
   (commit ID values will differ):

    ```
    * be67a87 (dev) Maybe we should all switch to emacs...
    * 7c5827f Add image file showing a visual overview of vim modes
    * c778c05 (HEAD -> main) Add 'command_mode' file: commands for vim's command mode
    * 8186e45 Add 'normal_mode' file: commands for vim's normal mode
    * c454a04 README: add vim modes and open file example
    * 0fbf901 First commit of the vim cheat-sheet project. Add README file
    ```

<br>

### Additional Tasks (if you have time)

7. **We would like to fix a small bug** in the `README.md` and `normal_mode.md`
   files.  
   Proceed as follows:
    * Make sure you are on branch `main`.
    * In the `README.md` file, remove the line starting with `TODO:`.
    * In the `normal_mode.md` file, remove the last two lines that contain
      duplicated commands (the `dd` and `yy` commands are listed twice).
    * For *each* file to correct, create a `--fixup` commit (meaning you create
      2 fixup commits). You should
      **carefully select to which commit each of the fixup applies**.
    * Rebase (interactively) the branch `main` using the **`--autosquash`**
      option to merge the `--fixup` commits as instructed.

   :dart:
   **Hint:** before the interactive rebase, your history on the `main` branch
   should look like this - notice the 2 **`fixup!`** commits
   (commit ID values will differ):
    ```
    * 542f88d (HEAD -> main) fixup! Add 'command_mode' file: commands for vim's command mode
    * f0d33d7 fixup! README: add vim modes and open file example
    * c778c05 Add 'command_mode' file: commands for vim's command mode
    * 8186e45 Add 'normal_mode' file: commands for vim's normal mode
    * c454a04 README: add vim modes and open file example
    * 0fbf901 First commit of the vim cheat-sheet project. Add README file
    ```

    <br>

8. Now that we modified `main`, **rebase `dev` on `main` again**.  
   :dart:
   **Hint:** to easily skip a commit, you can either use interactive rebase as
   we did earlier, or use a regular rebase and run **`git rebase --skip`** when
   a conflict arises (see also the message that Git is printing when a conflict
   is detected).

   After the rebase, switch back to the `main` branch and display the history
   of your repository (`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`). It should
   look like this (commit ID values will differ):
    ```
    * 062a1e2 (dev) Maybe we should all switch to emacs...
    * 07e7d86 Add image file showing a visual overview of vim modes
    * 9a0188b (HEAD -> main) Add 'command_mode' file: commands for vim's command mode
    * 4c17a23 Add 'normal_mode' file: commands for vim's normal mode
    * 3becef8 Edit README file: add vim modes and open file example
    * 0fbf901 First commit of the vim cheat-sheet project. Add README file
    ```

9. There are 2 more things you can try:
    * **Merge the first 2 commits of the repo** into a single one: for this
      you will need to use the **`--root`** option of the `git rebase` command
      (for details, see the course slides).
    * **Change the commit message** of the latest commit of the `dev` branch
      from `Maybe we should all switch to emacs...` to
      `Add xkcd comic image file`.


<br>

## Exercise 2 - The big reset [40 min]
**Objective:** get familiar with `git reset` and its `--mixed`, `--soft` and
`--hard` options.

In this exercise, we will build a Git repo to keep track of our favorite
[Chuck Norris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris) quotes :tada:.

:pushpin:
**Note:** in order show you some use cases of `git reset`, we will
**intentionally make some mistakes** along the way so that we can
then correct them. So don't be unsettled by the fact that this exercise keeps
asking you to change things: *it's by design*!

**Let's get started:**

1. Change into the `exercise_2/the_big_reset.git` directory, where you will
   find a number of files. Your first task is to turn this directory into a Git
   repository.

2. Add/Stage the file `README.md` to the Git repo, then make a first commit
   with the commit message `First commit` (or any other message you like).

3. Add/stage the file `my_quotes.md`, and make a new commit with the message
   `Add a file to keep track of quotes`.

4. Wait, that last commit message is not nearly dramatic enough for what is
   about to unfold in this exercise. Let's change it to:
   `Starting The Big Reset`.  
   :pushpin:
   **Note:** while the optimal way to do this is using `git commit --amend`,
   we here suggest that you try to use **`git reset`** (with either the
   **`--soft`** or **`--mixed`** option).

5. Actually, there's still a thing we forgot: there is a
   `chuck_norris_quotes.txt` file in the repo - but we will not track it. So
   let's put that file on the list of files to be ignored by Git and make this
   change **part of the very first commit of the history** (in other words, the
   file you create to ignore `chuck_norris_quotes.txt` should be part of the
   first commit).

   :dart:
   **Hint:** you will need to use a combination of **reset** and **amending**,
   and then re-do the second commit.

   :pushpin:
   **Note:** instead of re-doing the second commit, you could also delete the
   `my_quotes.md` file and then **cherry-pick** the `Starting The Big Reset!`
   commit you made earlier (this commit will be orphaned after you reset your
   `HEAD` to the first commit, but it can still be cherry-picked!). If you
   can't find its commit ID displayed in your shell, you can use the
   **`git reflog`** command to find it.

   <br>

6. Alright, fixing stuff is fun, but let's try to get some real work done here.
    * Open the `chuck_norris_quotes.txt` file and select your 3 favorite quotes.
    * Add each of your 3 quotes **successively** to the `my_quotes.md` file,
      making a new commit **each time** you add a quote.
    * So after that, you should have 3 additional commits in your history, and
      a total of 5 commits. Your git history should look like this (commit IDs
      will differ):
        ```
        * 5560a53 (HEAD -> main) Add 3rd favorite quote
        * e78e2ab Add 2nd favorite quote
        * 70c65be Add 1st favorite quote
        * c3d7850 Starting the Big Reset
        * e044feb First commit
        ```
        <br>

7. With so many epic quotes to chose from, it a real shame we can chose only 3!
   But wait - Git has a solution for us: **branches**!.  
   Create an alternate branch named `second_choice` at the point in history
   where the `my_quotes.md` file was still empty. Then switch to your new
   `second_choice` branch and verify that `my_quotes.md` does indeed not
   contain any quotes.

8. Add 3 new Chuck Norris quotes to the `my_quotes.md` file, and commit. This
   time, we make a single commit with all quotes. Then, have a look at your
   repo's history with `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`
   (or `git adog`, if you have created this alias).

   You should see that your 2 branches have diverged, like so:
    ```
    * 23c0462 (HEAD -> second_choice) Add alternate favorite quotes
    | * 5560a53 (main) Add 3rd favorite quote
    | * e78e2ab Add 2nd favorite quote
    | * 70c65be Add 1st favorite quote
    |/  
    * c3d7850 Starting the Big Reset
    * e044feb First commit
    ```
    <br>

9. Upon reflection, why not put all of our favorite quotes (who said we could
   have only 3!) into the `my_quotes.md` file on the `main` branch.  
   To do this, **merge branch `second_choice` into `main`**. This will be a
   **3-way merge** (i.e. a non-fast-forward merge) - so get ready for some
   possible **conflict resolution** action.

10. After the merge is done, let's look at the history of our Git repo again
    with `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`. You can see that, as
    expected, the 3-way merge introduced an additional **merge commit** (the
    commit `c6b02ce` in our example below), so our history is not as clean as
    could be.
    ```
    *   c6b02ce (HEAD -> main) Merge branch 'second_choice'
    |\  
    | * 23c0462 (second_choice) Add alternate favorite quotes
    * | 5560a53 Add 3rd favorite quote
    * | e78e2ab Add 2nd favorite quote
    * | 70c65be Add 1st favorite quote
    |/  
    * c3d7850 Starting the Big Reset
    * e044feb First commit
    ```

    Can we fix it? *Yes, we can!*
     * Revert the repository to its state before the merge.
       :dart: **Hint:** time to put that `--hard` option to good use!.
     * Rebase `second_choice` on `main`, before merging `second_choice` into
       `main`.
    <br>

    When you are done, run `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` and
    marvel at your perfectly clean history (commit IDs will differ).
    ```
    * 9f554ad (HEAD -> main, second_choice) Add alternate favorite quotes
    * 5560a53 Add 3rd favorite quote
    * e78e2ab Add 2nd favorite quote
    * 70c65be Add 1st favorite quote
    * c3d7850 Starting the Big Reset
    * e044feb First commit
    ```

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Exercise 3 - The backport [30 min]
**Objective:** learn to use `git stash` and `git tag`, understand the
**detached HEAD mode**.

You are busy working on the `dev` branch of a data analysis pipeline, when you
get a message from a user: they want you to backport the support for a new type
of input data onto an old version of the pipeline (version `1.0.1`). You try to
argue that this is an old version with security vulnerabilities, and that they
should not use it anymore... but they *just don't care*. As a problem never
comes alone, they need this *right now*.

1. Change into `exercise_3/backport.git` and have a look at the Git
   repository's history. Note the different branches and tags.  
   **Reminder:** you can use `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` to
   display the entire repo's history - or `git adog`, if you have created this
   alias.

2. Implementing the backport is urgent, so you will finish your work on the
   `dev` branch later.  
   **Stash away any uncommitted change**, so you don't lose your hard work.
   Then go back to version `1.0.1` of the project.
    * :question:
      **Question:** where is the `HEAD` pointer now?
    * :question:
      **Question:** has anything else changed in the repository's history?
   <br>

3. Implement the backport fix:
    * In the file `functions.py`, add support for JSON files by changing the
      line `if extension in [".img", ".txt", ".csv"]:` to
      `if extension in [".img", ".txt", ".csv", ".json"]:` (see, writing
      software is easy!).
    * Commit your change.
   <br>

4. Go back to the `dev` branch. As you leave, you should see a warning message
   from Git.
    * :question:
      **Question:** what would happen to our latest commit if we "leave it behind"?
    * Take Git's advice and create a new branch named `backport` that points to
      the commit we just left behind.
    * While we are at it, let's also add a **tag** `v1.0.1b` to our new commit.
   <br>

5. Technically, after tagging our new commit with `v1.0.1b`, the `backport`
   branch is not really needed anymore, since a tagged commit will not be
   garbage collected. So let's delete this branch (using force deletion if
   needed).

6. That's it, we're done with the backport. Now we can finally get back to work
   on `dev`.
    * Restore the stashed content on `dev`.
    * Commit the change - you can use the commit message
      `Improve file import tests`.
   <br>

   At this point, your working tree should be clean and you Git history should
   look like this:
    ```
    * 0bc9428 (HEAD -> dev) Improve file import tests
    * a9096d0 Add tests for import module
    * fe0cdf5 Rename import module file
    * 08470b9 Add new module for file import
    | * 1a2fa0c (tag: v1.0.1b) Backport: add support for 'json' file type
    | | * b7d3e86 (main) Improve code documentation
    | | * 5efa0e0 (tag: v1.0.2) Improve tests
    | |/  
    |/|   
    * | 81fcc20 Add new module for file export
    |/  
    * d2c319e (tag: v1.0.1) Add tests
    * 8f93dc0 Add import_file() function
    * a67a81f Add random class
    * 7332db6 (tag: v0.0.1) Add first version of code
    * e3c1543 First commit. Add README
    ```

<br>

### Additional Tasks (if you have time)

7. Update the `main` branch with the new commits from `dev`:
    * Rebase your `dev` branch onto `main`, before merging it into `main`.
    * Add a new tag `v2.0.0` to the latest commit on `main`.
   <br>

   Your git history should now look like this:
   ```
   * 7f37744 (HEAD -> main, tag: v2.0.0, dev) Improve file import tests
   * 9065d06 Add tests for import module
   * cd61372 Rename import module file
   * c6859d4 Add new module for file import
   * b7d3e86 Improve code documentation
   * 5efa0e0 (tag: v1.0.2) Improve tests
   * 81fcc20 Add new module for file export
   | * 1a2fa0c (tag: v1.0.1b) Backport: add support for 'json' file type
   |/  
   * d2c319e (tag: v1.0.1) Add tests
   * 8f93dc0 Add import_file() function
   * a67a81f Add random class
   * 7332db6 (tag: v0.0.1) Add first version of code
   * e3c1543 First commit. Add README
   ```


<br>
<br>
<br>


## Exercise 4 - The treasure hunt [120 min]
**Objective:** collaborative exercise to review the Git commands and concepts
seen during the course.  
For participants who wish to receive **ECTS credits** for this course, this
exercise also serves as **exam** - please see the instructions at the end of
the exercise on how to submit your work.

**We have saved the best for last!** In this collaborative exercise, you will
**team-up with two fellow pirates** in order to retrieve the lost treasure of
the feared pirate [John Longsilver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_John_Silver).  
Get ready for a quest that will be *legend* ... wait for it ... *dary !!*

### Introductory notes
While this exercise is somewhat *gameified*, it covers many of the important
operations and collaborative workflows you will encounter when doing real work.
For instance:
* Each of the *quests* you complete in this exercise should be seen as the
  equivalent of adding a **new feature** to a software or data analysis
  pipeline.
* Completing a quest, merging your work into the `main` branch and adding a tag,
  would be the equivalent of making a **new release** of your software/pipeline.

In your quests, you will be asked to follow a **collaborative workflow** that
uses the following branches:
* **`main`:** this is the *production* branch, i.e. the branch on which only
  final, production ready, material is published. Do *not* work directly on the
  `main` branch.
* Short-lived **personal branches** (feature branches) will be created by each
  team member to add their work, before merging it into `main`.
* Each **new release** of your work will be indicated by **a tag**.

If a divergence on the `main` branch occurs, you can either:
* **Rebase** your local changes in `main` onto `origin/main`: `git pull --rebase`.
  This is often the best solution, as it will give you a cleaner branch history
  than using a merge.
* **Merge** your local changes in `main` with `origin/main`: `git pull --no-rebase`.
* **Hard reset** your local `main` branch to `origin/main`: `git reset --hard origin/main`.
  Use this **with caution**, as it can result in loss of local commits or
  uncommitted changes to files.

:fire:
**Important** - please pay particular attention to:
* Keep a **clean history** by avoiding unnecessary merges. Rebase branches to
  be merged before merging them whenever possible (unless explicitly instructed
  otherwise).
* Use **clear and meaningful commit messages** for your commits.
* **Delete temporary branches** that are no longer needed (e.g. a personal
  feature branch).
* Please pay particular attention to these points if you are taking this
  exercise as **exam for the course**.
* **Make sure to fully, carefully, read the instructions and hints** given
  for each section, before starting the work.
* **Please ask for help** if you are stuck at any point, especially if you
  cannot solve one of the riddles.

<br>


### A) Organize your crew

1. **Get together:** go to the
   [course's google doc page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EX72NInz-eA2d2GOa5aTB8D88GWb91Sk-sCNHwQYXqE)
   and check which team you belong to by looking at the **Team** column in the
   GitHub/GitLab user names table.
    * **On-site course:** locate your other team members in the classroom and
      sit together so you can communicate.
    * **Online course:** you will be placed in a breakout-room with your
      teammates. Remember to use the "share screen" function to help each
      other or show to other team members what you are doing on your machine.

2. Organize your crew: within your pirate team, distribute the following roles:
   **Captain**, **Quartermaster** and **First-mate**. If your team is less than
   3 people, assign one person to multiple roles (e.g. one person is Captain
   and the other person is both Quartermaster and First-mate).

<br>


### B) Create a shared Git repo on GitHub/GitLab
1. Go to `exercise_4/treasure_hunt.git`. As you will see, this is a Git
   repository that already contains some files and commits.

2. :fire:
   **IMPORTANT step for Windows users**
   **(if you are on Linux or Mac, you should skip this step)**.
   Windows users only - run the following command *inside* the Git repository:
    ```yaml
    git config core.filemode false
    # Do not add the `--global` flag, so that this change only affects the current repo.
    ```
   This will instruct Git to ignore differences in *execution permissions* of
   files, and is needed because Windows does not use the same file permission
   system as Linux/MacOS.

3. The first thing you need to do before embarking on your quest is to
   **setup a remote repository** for your crew on either
   [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
   You will use this as a shared remote repo to synchronize your local Git
   repos within the team.

   As you only need 1 remote for the entire team, proceed as follows:
    * **One team member** should create a new **public repository** under
      their GitHub/GitLab user account. You can name it anything,
      e.g. `treasure-hunt`.
    * Once the repo is created, the owner of the repo must **give access** to
      the **other team members**, who must **accept the invitation** to join
      the new repo (you will in receive an email from GitHub/GitLab, or you can
      check the notifications in your GitHub/GitLab user account).
    * :dart: **Hint:** for instructions on how to create a new repo on
      GitHub/GitLab and how to give access to other people, please see the
      exercise 4 helper slides.
   <br>

4. All members of the crew should add the newly created GitHub/GitLab project
   as a **remote** to their local copy of `treasure_hunt.git` (please use
   `origin` as remote name).  
   In addition:
    * One pirate should **push the `main` branch** to the remote.
    * The other pirates, should set `origin/main` as the **upstream** for their
      local `main` branch. This is done with the following commands:
      ```yaml
      git fetch
      git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
      ```
      This tells Git that the remote branch `origin/main` is the remote branch
      associated to your local branch `main` (so when you pull or push, it will
      pull/push from/to that branch).

### C) Treasure hunt part one: sign the pirate code
Even pirates have rules! To avoid disputes at sea, you and your fellow pirates
should start your journey by carrying-out a little paperwork: signing the
[pirate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_code).

Signing the **pirate code**, and thereby officializing your participation and
rank in the treasure hunt, is done by adding your name next to your role at the
bottom of the `pirate_code.md` file, which is located at the root of the git
repo.
Please **pay particular attention to articles IX, X and XI of the contract!**

1. **Sign the pirate code:**
    * Each pirate creates a new local personal branch (pointing at the latest
      commit of `main`): the personal branches should be named `add-crew-cp`
      (Captain), `add-crew-qm` (Quartermaster) and `add-crew-fm` (First-mate)
      respectively.
    * On your personal branch, sign the pirate code by replacing `NAME HERE`
      with your name (on the line that is matching your rank).  
      :fire:
      **Important:** only sign for yourself, not for others!
    * Make a commit with a **meaningful commit message**.
    * In addition, the **First-mate** should make some changes to article I of
      the pirate code in order to get an equal share of the treasure! This
      change should be added as a new commit to the first-mate's personal
      branch.

2. **Share the signatures:** In turn, each pirate can now add their commit to
   the `main` branch by:
    * Pulling new changes on `main` from the remote.
    * Rebasing their personal branch on `main` (the first person to add
      their commit does in principle not need to do this).
    * Merging their personal branch into `main` - this should now be a
      **fast-forward** merge.
    * Pushing their changes on `main` back to the remote.
    * Inform other team members that they can now pull the changes on `main`
      (so that everyone stays in sync).

3. **When everyone has added their changes to `main`** (and everyone has
   pulled the changes), the `pirate_code.md` file in everyone's local `main`
   branch should now contain the signatures of the entire crew.  
   To verify that things were done properly, run the following in your shell
   (while on the `main` branch):
    ```yaml
    ./verify_contract.sh
    ```
   The names and ranks of all crew-members should be proudly displayed (note:
   you must be at the root of the git repo to run this command).

4. If the step above is working as expected for the entire team, it's time to
   **make a new release** of your work:
    * To label this new "release", the **Quartermaster** should add a **tag**
      named **`contract-signed`** (on the latest commit of `main`) , then push
      the tag to the remote with:
        ```yaml
        git push origin --tags
        ```
    * The **Captain** and the **First-mate** should then run `git fetch` to
      retrieve the newly added tag from the remote.
    * At this point, everyone should have the new tag in their local repo and
      everyone's `main` branch should be pointing to the same (latest) commit.
      Remember that you can use the command
      `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` to display your entire
      repo history along with tags.

5. Each pirate can now delete their personal branch (`add-crew-cp`,
   `add-crew-qm`, `add-crew-fm`).

That's it, the paperwork is done! Let's get on that ship and sail! :skull:

<br>


### D) Treasure hunt part two: gear-up!
Wait... did I just say "get on that ship"? Well, you see, the problem is
that... there is no ship... yet! And we will need a flag too! And rum of
course, lots of rum for this long journey.

The second part of this quest is therefore to find those 3 items: **a ship**,
**a flag**, and **rum bottles**.  
You are 3 in the team, so split the task:
* The **Captain** will search for the **ship**.
* The **Quartermaster** will search for the **flag**.
* The **First-mate** will search for **rum bottles**.

This is how you should proceed:

1. As for the first quest (*Signing the pirate code*), each pirate should
   create a new personal branch to work on this quest: `add-supplies-cp`
   (Captain), `add-supplies-qm` (Quartermaster) and `add-supplies-fm`
   (First-mate).  
   As usual, the personal branches should initially be rooted the latest commit
   of `main`.

2. If you look at the history of the `treasure_hunt.git` repo, you will see
   that it has several branches that correspond to different locations:
   **`Port-royal`**, **`Oyster-bay`** and **`Blackbird-castle`**.
   Visit these different locations and ask local pirates for a hint of where
   you can find the ship, flag and rum bottles by running the following command
   in your shell:
    ```yaml
    ./ask_a_pirate.sh
    ```

   :dart:
   **Hints:**
    * **Locations correspond to commits!** Look at the history of the
      `Port-royal`, `Blackbird-castle`, and `Oyster-bay` branches to find the
      commit where an item is hidden (based on the hints you received from the
      pirates).
    * To visit a location, switch to the corresponding branch or check-out the
      corresponding commit. Then explore the content of the working tree with
      `ls -l`.
    * Each item to find corresponds to a file: `ship.ascii`, `flag.ascii` and
      `rhum.ascii`. Note that the files
      **are located in a subdirectory named `supplies/`**.
    * Each team member should search for 1 item (as specified above).
   <br>

3. Once you have located the commit with the item you are looking for, you
   should add it to your personal branch by **cherry-picking** the commit onto
   your personal branch.

4. In turn, each pirate can now add their commit to the `main` branch using
   the same procedure as in the first part of the quest - see **point 2** of
   *Treasure hunt part one: sign the pirate code* if you need a refresher.

5. After all pirates have added their commit and updated their repo, everyone's
   `main` branch should have 3 new commits (one made by each team member), and
   the 3 files `ship.ascii`, `flag.ascii` and `rhum.ascii` should be present in
   the `supplies/` directory.

6. **Verify that you have all your gear** by running the command (on the
   `main` branch):
    ```yaml
    ./verify_supplies.sh
    ```
   If your ship is loaded with the correct supplies, a success message will be
   displayed.

7. If everyone got a success message, it's time to **make a new release** of
   your work:
    * To label this new "release", the **First-mate** should add a **tag**
      named **`ready-to-sail`** on the latest commit of `main`, then push the
      tag to the remote with the command:
        ```yaml
        git push origin --tags
        ```
    * The **Captain** and the **Quartermaster** should then run `git fetch` to
      retrieve the newly added tag from the remote.
    * At this point, everyone should have the new tag in their local repo and
      everyone's `main` branch should be pointing to the same (latest) commit.

8. Each pirate can now delete their personal branch (`add-supplies-cp`,
   `add-supplies-qm`, `add-supplies-fm`).

The ship is loaded and the flag is flying - now we're talking! All hands on
deck and keep the powder dry - get ready for the final step of this
*gitventure*: finding **the treasure!** :whale:

<br>


### E) Treasure hunt part three: visit Skull-rock island to find the treasure
Start by setting sail on `Skull-rock-island` (i.e. switch to the branch). The
island was home to **John Longsilver** - a fearsome pirate with a healthy
appetite for treasures. Unfortunately, pirate lives do sometimes take a turn
for the shorter, and so did Longsilver's.

While Longsilver is no more, his **trusty parrot** - a talkative bird if there
ever was one! - is still very much alive. Maybe that bird has some recollection
of where Longsilver has been hiding his treasure?

To hear what the parrot has to say, run the following command in your shell:
 ```yaml
 ./listen_to_parrot.sh
 ```
As you can see for yourself, the parrot isn't being helpful... but we can
change this, with a little... rebasing!

Proceed as follows:
 1. **Switch** to the branch `work-in-progress`.
 2. **Merge the commit** `Update the parrot's talking` into the commit
    `Make the parrot more cooperative` using **interactive rebase** (i.e. these
    two commits should become a single commit).
 3. **Rebase** the `work-in-progress` branch on the `Skull-rock-island` branch.
    If any conflict arises during the rebase, keep the version of the file(s)
    that is(are) coming from the `work-in-progress` branch.
 4. After the rebase is completed, run again:
     ```yaml
     ./listen_to_parrot.sh
     ```
    The bird should now be more cooperative and give you some hints on where to
    look for **the keys** to unlock the **treasure chest**.

You should now also have a new directory named `treasure_chest` at the root of
your Git repo.

To bring the treasure chest aboard your ship, the **First-mate** should do the
following:
 1. Merge `work-in-progress` into the `Skull-rock-island` branch (at this
    point this should be a fast-forward merge).
 2. Merge `Skull-rock-island` into the `main` branch. This will add the
    treasure chest to the `main` branch - along with your new friend the
    parrot!
 3. Push the changes on branch `main` to the remote.

The **Captain** and **Quartermaster** can now update their local repos with the
changes that the **First-mate** just pushed to `main`. At this point everyone
should be synchronized on their `main` branch and have the treasure onboard.

Congratulations, you're *almost* there! Let's celebrate this with a
**new release**:
 * The **Captain** should add a tag named **`treasure-found`** and push it to
   the remote with:
    ```yaml
    git push origin --tags
    ```
 * Everyone else can then run `git fetch` to get the new tag.

Alright, let's see what John Longsilver has been hiding in his treasure. To
open it, run:
```yaml
./open_chest.sh
```
*Shiver me timbers!* We are missing **the keys** to open the lock!

<br>

:pushpin:
**Note:** If you are running out of time, you can finish this last part of the
exercise on your own. You simply have to find the 3 keys for the treasure on
your own.

<br>


### F) Treasure hunt final part: opening the treasure
We are now looking for the **3 keys to open the 3 locks of the chest**. To find
where they are hidden, listen to the parrot's hints by running the command:
```yaml
./listen_to_parrot.sh
```
Then go back to `Port-royal`, `Blackbird-castle` and `Oyster-bay` to find the
keys.

:dart:
**Hints - please read this carefully _before_ you begin:**
* Unlike in the previous quest, the locations that the parrot gives in its
  hints correspond here to **directories** on disk - *not* to commits!
* The **keys** are files that have the name of the object that contains them or
  is near them. E.g. a file named `candle` would be the "key" file if you think
  that the key is near a candle.
* Each key file must be placed in the correct lock directory, and renamed to
  the correct name:
  * **Key 1** must be placed into `treasure_chest/lock_1` and renamed `key_1`.
  * **Key 2** must be placed into `treasure_chest/lock_2` and renamed `key_2`.
  * **Key 3** must be placed into `treasure_chest/lock_3` and renamed `key_3`.
* Once you have located the correct file (based on the hints given by the
  parrot), **checkout** the file to the `main` branch, rename and move it to
  the correct location (see above), and make a new commit.
  * **Reminder:** to **checkout a single file** from another branch use the
    command:
    ```yaml
    git checkout <branch name> <path/to/file>
    ```
    For this exercise, run the command while located at the root of
    `treasure_hunt.git`.
  * To move and rename the file, use the command:
    ```yaml
    git mv <path/to/file> treasure_chest/lock_1/key_1  # For key 1
    git mv <path/to/file> treasure_chest/lock_2/key_2  # For key 2
    git mv <path/to/file> treasure_chest/lock_3/key_3  # For key 3
    ```

  * :sparkles:
    **Note:** it is also possible to use `git restore -s <branch name> <path/to/file>`
    instead of `git checkout`.

* :bomb:
  **Do not modify the content of the key file in any way, this would destroy the keys**.

As before, this can be done as teamwork and each pirate retrieves one of the
keys. This time however, **to save time** (and because we believe that by now
you have understood the principle), you may
**add your commit directly to `main` branch**, without created a temporary
personal working branch (*crazy!* - I know :sunglasses:).  
Make sure to actively coordinate with your team mates so that your `main`
branch is up-to-date before you add a commit to it: you don't want any
divergence in the `main` branch among the team!  

When each pirate has added his key to `main` and everyone has updated their
local Git repo copies, you can try to run again:
```yaml
./open_chest.sh
```
If the keys are the correct files, have been placed in the correct lock, and
have been correctly renamed, **the treasure should open**! :tada:

<br>
