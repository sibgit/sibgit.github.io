		<h1>Pallas's Cat</h1>

		<img src="Manoel.jpg">

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The Pallas's cat's range extends from the Caucasus eastward to Central Asia, Mongolia and adjacent parts of Dzungaria and the Tibetan Plateau. It inhabits montane shrublands and grasslands, rocky outcrops, scree slopes and ravines in areas, where the continuous snow cover is below 15–20 cm (6–8 in).[14] In the southwestern part of its range, the habitat of the Pallas's cat is affected by cold and dry winters, and moderate to low rainfall in warm summers.[20] The typical vegetation in this part consists of small shrubs, sagebrush (Artemisia), Festuca and Stipa grasses.[14] In the central part of its range, it inhabits hilly landscapes, high plateaus and intermontane valleys that are covered by dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation, such as low shrubs and xerophytic grasses.[21] The continental climate in this region exhibits a range of 80 °C (176 °F) between the highest and lowest air temperatures, dropping to −50 °C (−58 °F) in winter.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>

		    This small cat species feeds on a broad range of rodents, birds, insects, reptiles, and even carrion.

			The Pallas's cat is a highly specialised predator of small mammals, which it catches by stalking or ambushing near exits of burrows. It also pulls out rodents with its paws from shallow burrows. In the Altai Mountains, remains of long-tailed ground squirrel (Urocitellus undulatus), flat-skulled shrew (Sorex roboratus), Pallas's pika (Ochotona pallasi) and bird feathers were found near breeding burrows of Pallas's cats. In Transbaikal, it preys on Daurian pika (Ochotona dauurica), steppe pika (O. pusilla), Daurian ground squirrel (Spermophilus dauricus) and young of red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax).[14] Scat samples of the Pallas's cat collected in the bufferzone of Khustain Nuruu National Park in central Mongolia contained foremost remains of Daurian pika, Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), Mongolian silver vole (Alticola semicanus) and remains of passerine birds, beetles and grasshoppers.[57] Brandt's vole (Lasiopodomys brandtii) dominated in the diet of Pallas's cats in Mongolia's Sükhbaatar Province after the irruptive growth of this vole population during 2017 to 2020.[58] Scat found in Shey-Phoksundo National Park contained remains of pika species and of woolly hare (Lepus oiostolus).[51] Remains of a cypriniform fish were found in Pallas's cat scat in Gongga Mountain Nature Reserve.[59]

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			The Pallas's cat is solitary.[14] Of nine Pallas's cat kittens observed in captivity, only the two males scent marked by spraying urine.[54] The Pallas's cat uses caves, rock crevices and marmot burrows as shelter.[14]: 690–691  In central Mongolia, 29 Pallas's cat were fitted with radio collars between June 2005 and October 2007. They used 101 dens during this time, including 39 winter dens, 42 summer dens and 20 dens for raising kittens. The summer and winter dens usually had one entrance with a diameter of 15.6 to 23.4 cm (6.1 to 9.2 in). They resided in the summer dens for 2–21 days, and in the winter dens for 2–28 days. Summer and maternal dens were close to rocky habitats with little direct sunlight, whereas winter dens were closer to ravines.[55] The home ranges of 16 females varied from 7.4 to 125.2 km2 (2.9 to 48.3 sq mi). The home ranges of nine males varied from 20.9 to 207.0 km2 (8.1 to 79.9 sq mi) and overlapped those of one to four females and partly also those of other males. The sizes of their home ranges decreased in winter.[39]
