		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The Pallas's cat's range extends from the Caucasus eastward to Central Asia, Mongolia and adjacent parts of Dzungaria and the Tibetan Plateau. It inhabits montane shrublands and grasslands, rocky outcrops, scree slopes and ravines in areas, where the continuous snow cover is below 15–20 cm (6–8 in).[14] In the southwestern part of its range, the habitat of the Pallas's cat is affected by cold and dry winters, and moderate to low rainfall in warm summers.[19] The typical vegetation in this part consists of small shrubs, sagebrush (Artemisia), Festuca and Stipa grasses.[14] In the central part of its range, it inhabits hilly landscapes, high plateaus and intermontane valleys that are covered by dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation, such as low shrubs and xerophytic grasses.[20] The continental climate in this region exhibits a range of 80 °C (176 °F) between the highest and lowest air temperatures, dropping to −50 °C (−58 °F) in winter.[14]: 684–688 

			The Greater Caucasus region is considered climatically suitable for the Pallas's cat.[19] In Armenia, an individual was killed near Vedi in the mountains of Ararat Province in the late 1920s.[16] In January 2020, an individual was sighted about 140 km (90 mi) farther north in Tavush Province; the habitat at this location transitions from semi-desert to montane steppe at an elevation of about 570 m (1,900 ft).[21] Records in Azerbaijan are limited to a Pallas's cat skin found in Karabakh and a sighting of an individual in Julfa District, both in the late 20th century.[22]

			The Pallas's cat inhabits rocky slopes in the Koh-i-Baba Range of the Hindu Kush.
			On the Iranian Plateau, two Pallas's cats were encountered near the Aras River in northwestern Iran before the 1970s.[14] In the area, an individual was captured at an elevation of about 1,500 m (5,000 ft) near Azarshahr in East Azerbaijan Province in 2008.[22] In the same year, a camera trap recorded a Pallas's cat on the southern slopes of the central Alborz Mountains in Khojir National Park shortly after heavy snowfall.[23] Farther east in the Alborz Mountains, an individual was recorded among rocks at an elevation of 2,441 m (8,009 ft) in 2016.[24] In the Aladagh and Kopet Dag Mountains, the Pallas's cat was recorded inside and in the vicinity of protected areas.[25] In the south of the Zagros Mountains, an individual was caught in a corral used by transhumant pastoralists in Abadeh County in 2012. The surrounding area consists of rocky steppe habitat dominated by mountain almond (Prunus scoparia), Astragalus and Artemisia.[26] In the Hindu Kush, a Pallas's cat was observed sunbathing at the fringe of a rocky high-elevation plain near Dasht-e Nawar in Afghanistan's Koh-i-Baba range in April 2007.[27] The Pallas's cat was also photographed multiple times in Bamyan Province between 2015 and 2017.[19] In Gilgit-Baltistan, an individual was recorded on a ridge in a juniper dominated forest at 3,445 m (11,302 ft) in Pakistan's Qurumber National Park in July 2012.[28]

			In the Transcaspian Region, its presence was first reported in the Kopet Dag mountains and in the vicinity of the Tedzhen and Murghab Rivers in the late 19th century.[29] In Turkmenistan's Sünt-Hasardag Nature Reserve, a camera trap recorded an individual in 2019. The Pallas's cat is allegedly also present in Köpetdag Nature Reserve.[30]

			Historical records of the Pallas's cat are known in the Surxondaryo Region and Gissar Range along the border of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.[14] In Kyrgyzstan, it is present at high elevations of Sarychat-Ertash State Nature Reserve and in the foothills of the Alay Range.[20] In 2013, a dead female was found in a valley near Engilchek, Kyrgyzstan.[31] In Kazakhstan, it inhabits the highlands and steppes of central and east Kazakhstan Region, the periphery of the Betpak-Dala Desert, the northern Balkhash District and the Tarbagatai Mountains.[20]

			The species inhabits grassland on the Ukuk Plateau.
			In the South Siberian Mountains, it inhabits grasslands on the Ukok Plateau and in the Altai, Kuray and Saylyugem Mountains.[32] It is also present in Chagan-Uzun and Argut river basins, Mongun-Taiga, Uvs Lake Basin, Sayano-Shushenski Nature Reserve, Tunkinsky National Park, Lake Gusinoye basin and in the interfluves of the Selenga, Chikoy and Khilok rivers.[33] In the eastern Sayan Mountains, its presence was documented for the first time in 1997.[34] In Transbaikal, it inhabits montane steppes at elevations of 600–800 m (2,000–2,600 ft), where annual rainfall ranges from 150 to 400 mm (5.9 to 15.7 in).[35] In 2013, an individual was observed on the Vitim Plateau.[36]

			The Pallas's cat inhabits the semi-desert steppe of Ikh Nartiin Chuluu Nature Reserve in Mongolia.[37] In Khustain Nuruu National Park, it prefers rocky habitat that provides cover and camouflage.[38] On the Tibetan plateau, two Pallas's cats were observed in undulating alpine meadow amidst plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) colonies at 4,087 m (13,409 ft) in western China's Qumarlêb County in 2001. One of them swam across an irrigation channel.[39] In Gêrzê County, an individual was sighted in desert steppe habitat at an elevation of 5,050 m (16,570 ft) in 2005.[40] In 2011, the Pallas's cat was photographed in an alpine meadow in the core area of Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve.[41] In Ruoergai, it was observed at several places in habitat that was frequented by pastoralists and their livestock herds.[42][43]

			The Pallas's cat occurs in alpine pastures of the upper Marshyangdi river valley in the central Himalayas.
			The presence of the Pallas's cat in the Himalayas was first reported in Ladakh's Indus valley in 1991.[44] In Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary, Pallas's cats were sighted close by riverbanks at elevations of 4,202 and 4,160 m (13,786 and 13,648 ft) in 2013 and 2015.[45] In Gangotri National Park, a Pallas's cat was photographed in rocky alpine scrub at 4,800 m (15,700 ft) in 2019.[46] In Sikkim, an individual was observed on a rocky slope at an elevation of 5,073 m (16,644 ft) in the vicinity of Tso Lhamo Lake in 2007.[47] In December 2012, the Pallas's cat was recorded for the first time in the Nepal Himalayas. It was photographed in the upper Marshyangdi river valley in alpine pastures at elevations of 4,200 m (13,800 ft) and 4,650 m (15,260 ft) in Annapurna Conservation Area.[48] In Shey-Phoksundo National Park, Pallas's cat scat was detected at 5,593 m (18,350 ft) in 2016, the globally highest record to date.[49] In January 2012, it was recorded for the first time in Bhutan, namely in rolling hills dominated by glacial outwash and alpine steppe vegetation in Wangchuck Centennial National Park.[50] In autumn 2012, it was also photographed at an elevation of 4,122 m (13,524 ft) in Jigme Dorji National Park.[51]
