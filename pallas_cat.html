		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Lives exclusively in the Himalaya.
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Pallas' cats are carnivores and eat mainly small rodents, including gerbils, voles, hamsters, pikas and small marmots. They will also eat small lizards and birds. They ambush their prey rather than chasing it, often waiting at the exits of rodent burrows or even sticking their paws in to try to scoop out their prey.<br>Source: https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/pallas-cat
