		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>

			?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's habitat and distribution.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			The Pallas's cat is a specialized predator of small mammals, which it captures by stalking, ambushing, or pulling them from shallow burrows.
			<br>
			Its diet varies by region, including species like ground squirrels, pikas, and birds, as well as insects and beetles in some areas.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Pallas cats are solitary, only meeting to reproduce from September to December. Similarly to most cats, Pallas cats are crepuscular during the summer, but are more active during the day time during the winter months. They hunt mainly for small mammals.
