	Pallas’s cats have a patchy range across much of South, North, East and Central Asia’s snowy, cold steppe.
	They prefer habitats like grasslands or deserts with vegetation or rocky outcroppings for cover.
	While their bodies are adapted for snow, they seldom inhabit areas with snow cover of more than 15 cm (about 6 inches).
	Their main stronghold is in Russia, Mongolia and western China, with significant populations in Kazakhstan, Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan.
	Small populations also exist in South Asia, with little known about populations that reside in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.
