		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The Pallas's cat lives in high altitude grasslands and shrublands with low snow coverage.Its presence has been recorded in the Caucasus, Iranian Plateau, Hindu Kush, parts of the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau, Altai-Sayan region and South Siberian Mountains. 		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			The pallas's cat feeds on cute little furry animals that are unlucky enough to be smaller than their predator.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Most active at dawn and dusk, these elusive cats are solitary except during mating season or when a mother is caring for her kittensâ€”teaching them the skills they will need for survival. Pallas' cats den in small caves and cracks and in the abandoned burrows of marmots, foxes and badgers.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			It's cute and furry and loves to live in freedom.

			This lovable small wildcat is known for its unusual, and adorable, look: a flattened and rounded face, stocky build, and super fluffiness make it appear stout and plush.

			Pictures of this cat are either majestic or this is the grumpiest cat you have ever seen.
