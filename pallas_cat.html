		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The Pallas's cat's range extends from the causcasus eastward to Central Asia, Mongolia and adjacent parts of Dzungaria and the Tibetan Plateau.<br> 
			It inhabits montane scrublands and grasslands, rocky outcrops, scree slopes and ravines in areas, where the continuous snow cover is below 15-20cm. <br> 
			The Greater Caucasus region is considered climatically suitable for the Pallas's cat. <br>
			The Pallas's cat inhabitats the semi-desert stepper of Ikh Nartiin Chuluu Nature Reserve in Mongolia.
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			The Pallas's cat is a specialized predator of small mammals, which it captures by stalking, ambushing, or pulling them from shallow burrows.
			<br>
			Its diet varies by region, including species like ground squirrels, pikas, and birds, as well as insects and beetles in some areas.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Pallas cats are solitary, only meeting to reproduce from September to December. Similarly to most cats, Pallas cats are crepuscular during the summer, but are more active during the day time during the winter months. They hunt mainly for small mammals.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			That it looks like a big grumpy but cute cat.
