# Version control with Git: setting-up your environment

Please complete the setup instructions given in this document
**before the start of the course**.

:fire:
In particular, make sure that you:

* Have installed a relatively **recent version of Git** (>= 2.23.0).
* **Provide us with your GitHub user name** by adding your GitHub user name
  to the "GitHub user names" table in the shared document used for the course
  (link to document communicated via email). Please do this at the latest the
  day before the class.
* For online classes, you should have a computer with a **working microphone**
  as some exercises involve collaboration/communication with other participants.

## 1. Installing Git on your computer

To install Git, please refer to the relevant section below depending on your
operating system.

* **Linux:** install Git using your distribution's official package manager.
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install git`
  * Fedora/CentOS: `dnf install git`  

* **MacOS:** Download Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  and follow the installation instructions.  
  Alternatively, if you are using the Homebrew package manager, you can also
  install Git with `brew install git`.

* **Windows:** download Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  and follow the installation instructions.  
  When the installation is complete, open the `Git Bash` application from the
  Windows start menu. This application acts as a small Linux shell (terminal),
  with Git and a few other basic GNU-Linux tools installed (e.g. the `vim` and
  `nano` editors).

To test whether your installation was successful, try to run `git --version`.

## 2. Create a GitHub account

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a commercial hosting platform for Git
repositories, currently owned by Microsoft.  

We will use GitHub for some of the course exercises, and you will therefore
need a (free) account on GitHub to use during the course.

* If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to
  [www.github.com](https://www.github.com) and create a new account.
* **Add your GitHub user name** to the "GitHub user names" table in the shared
  document used for the course (link to document communicated via email).
  This is needed so that we can add you to projects used during the exercises.
* Please do this **at the latest the day before the start of the course** as it
  sometimes takes a bit of time before invitations to join a new project are
  sent-out by GitHub.
* The **GitHub user names** table in the shared document will also be used to
  define teams for the collaborative exercises of the course (see the "Team"
  column of the table). If you are participating in the course with
  colleagues, you can register in the same team.
