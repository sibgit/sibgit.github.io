# Version control with Git: setting-up your environment

Please complete the setup instructions given in this document
**before the start of the course**.

üî• In particular, make sure to:

* **Install** a relatively **recent version of Git** (>= 2.23.0).
* **Provide us with your GitHub user name** by adding it to the
  "GitHub user names" table in the shared document used for the course
  (link to document communicated via email). Please do this at the latest 2
  days before the class.
* For online classes, you should have a computer with a **working microphone**
  as some exercises involve collaboration/communication with other participants.

## 1. Installing Git on your computer

To install Git, please refer to the relevant section below depending on your
operating system. More details are available on the
[official download page](https://git-scm.com/install). To test whether your
installation was successful, try to run the command:

```sh
git --version
```

### Linux üêß

You can easily install Git using your distribution's official package manager.

* Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install git`
* Fedora/CentOS: `dnf install git`  

For other linux distributions, please consult the
[official documentation](https://git-scm.com/install/linux).

### MacOS üå±

The easiest way to install Git on MacOS is using the Homebrew package manager:
`brew install git`

For more details, please see the
[official documentation](https://git-scm.com/install/mac).

### Windows üê≥

Download Git from [the official download page](https://git-scm.com/install/win)
and follow the installation instructions.  

When the installation is complete, open the `Git Bash` application from the
Windows start menu. This application acts as a small Linux shell (terminal),
with Git and a few other basic GNU-Linux tools installed (e.g. the `vim` and
`nano` editors).

## 2. Create a GitHub account :octocat:

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a commercial hosting platform for Git
repositories, currently owned by Microsoft.  

We will use GitHub for some of the course exercises, and you will therefore
need a (free) account on GitHub to use during the course.

* If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to
  [www.github.com](https://www.github.com) and **create a new account**.
* **Add your GitHub user name** to the "GitHub user names" table in the shared
  document used for the course (link to document communicated via email).
  This is needed so that we can add you to projects used during the exercises.
* Please do this **at the latest 2 days before the start of the course** as it
  sometimes takes a bit of time before invitations to join a new project are
  sent-out by GitHub.
* The **GitHub user names** table in the shared document will also be used to
  set-up teams for the collaborative exercises of the course (see the "Team"
  column of the table). If you are participating in the course with colleagues,
  you can register in the same team (unless you would rather *not* work with
  them üòÖ).
