		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
The kiwi is an endemic species of New Zealand. It lives in New Zealand's orested areas that tend to be very steep and wet. It typically lives surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth.

		<p>
Most other ratites prefer living in open areas, where they can spot predators easily and run away unimpeded. Kiwis, with their short legs and bowling ball bodies, use a different strategy. These birds inhabit densely forested areas and regions with lots of underbrush in which to hide from predators.Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat.

Some of the different ecosystems that they utilize include scrub forests, forests, woodlands, brushy grasslands, and more. Habitat destruction has pressured these birds into utilizing a wider variety of habitats than they normally would.
