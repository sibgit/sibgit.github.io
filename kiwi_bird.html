		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
	 Replace this with a few lines on the animal's habitat and distributionThe kiwi 
lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very steep and wet, surrounded by 
shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth.

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			The kiwi's mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced 
predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced 
to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains. Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the 
only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms.
