		<h1>Apteryx australis (Kiwi bird or Southern brown kiwi)</h1>

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
The kiwi is an endemic species of New Zealand. It lives in New Zealand's orested areas that tend to be very steep and wet. It typically lives surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth.
		</p>	
		<p>
Most other ratites prefer living in open areas, where they can spot predators easily and run away unimpeded. Kiwis, with their short legs and bowling ball bodies, use a different strategy. These birds inhabit densely forested areas and regions with lots of underbrush in which to hide from predators.Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat.

		<p>
Some of the different ecosystems that they utilize include scrub forests, forests, woodlands, brushy grasslands, and more. Habitat destruction has pressured these birds into utilizing a wider variety of habitats than they normally would.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
The southern brown kiwi has a long slender bill with lateral nostrils at the tip, which helps give them their keen sense of smell. They utilise this, more than sight and sound, to forage in dirt for invertebrates, including earthworms, beetle larvae, snails, spiders, centipedes, and orthoptera. Its gizzard is weak, and underutilised due to the lack of plant matter. Its caeca are long and narrow and aid in digestion.
		</p>	

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
Southern brown kiwi communicate vocally to aid in defending their territory. They will also sing duets with each other, with the male shrill "kee-wee" or "kee-kee" and the females hoarse "kurr kurr". Males are more vocal and they both call in an upright position with their legs stretched out and their bill pointing up.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>

Marina: I like it because it is exceptional from an evolutionary point of view. I want to study its genome.
