		<h1>Kiwi bird</h1>

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat.
		</p>

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Kiwi’s diets are quite varied and while they differ slightly by species, they are generally omnivorous. Earthworms comprise a majority of the kiwi diet but will also readily eat insects, snails, spiders, crayfish, eels, amphibians, seeds, fruits, other plant material and more. 
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Kiwis are typically active during the night, during which they will go foraging for food. Unlike any other bird, kiwis’ nostrils are located near the end of their beak and contribute to their keen sense of smell. They use their sense of smell to locate prey underground and will use their beaks to dig up them up. When not foraging, kiwis will patrol their territory and mark it by leaving highly odorous droppings. Although generally solitary animals, occasionally when kiwis bond with a mate, the pair may live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. kiwis nest in burrows and will lay usually large eggs relative to their body size. As a result, usually only one egg is laid per season.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			Kiwi chicks will kick their way out of an egg and are already fully covered in feathers. Also, Kiwis have cat-like whiskers.
			The fact that so closely resembles the kiwi-fruit.
