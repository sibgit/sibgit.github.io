		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat.

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>

			Kiwi birds are shy and timid by nature and prefers to stay away from human habitat.
