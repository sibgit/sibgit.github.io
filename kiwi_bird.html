        <h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>

            ?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's habitat
            and distribution.

        <h3>Diet / behavior / social organization</h3>
        <p>
            The kiwi's mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains.[29] Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them.[29] This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions. It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey, but this has not been scientifically observed. Lab experiments have suggested that A. australis can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions. Instead, the kiwi may rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile cues.

        <h3>What makes this animal awesome</h3>
        <p>
            The kiwi is an amazing bird because of its unique traits that make it seem more like a mammal than a typical bird. Native to New Zealand, it is a nocturnal, flightless species with soft, hair-like feathers, an excellent sense of smell, and nostrils at the tip of its beak â€” a rare feature among birds. Female kiwis lay enormous eggs that can weigh up to one-fifth of their body weight. Despite their small size and unusual appearance, kiwis are a national symbol of New Zealand and a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation.
