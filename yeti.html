		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The Himalayan mountains are a rough and harsh place to live.
			<br><br>
			The average annual temperature for the Himalayan mountains is 47 degrees Fahrenheit.  Although this may not sound too cold, the temperature in this mountain range is constantly changing according to the elevation. The lower the elevation, the lower the temperature will be.  This constant variation of temperature is something the Yeti has evolved to with its thick fur coat.
			<br><br>
			The Yeti will usually claim a cave found in the side of a mountain.  The Yeti is an intelligent being, having the mind and mental capability similar to apes. As a result and mostly after trial and error in the Yeti's free time, their home usually ends up well organized. Snow could be piled in a corner as a bed.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			The Yeti does not have much problem in obtaining food since it is rather strong and fast.  It is primarily carnivorous, but will consume plants if necessary. In a dire situation, it is not very picky about its meal. For a meat course, the Yeti will typically feed on non-predator animals, such as the Argali sheep, the Bharal, the Markhor, which are both either in sheep or goat families.  If meat is scarce, the Yeti will usually turn to any bamboo that's around, but little else due to lack of availability.  The Yeti has no predators and is at the top of its food chain.

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			?? Replace this with a few lines on the animal's behaviour.
		</p>

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			I like that Yeti lives in region with snow, which is less and less occuring in eastern Europe.
