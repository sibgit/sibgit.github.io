		<h1>?? Animal name</h1>

		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			The Himalayan mountains are a rough and harsh place to live.
			<br><br>
			The average annual temperature for the Himalayan mountains is 47 degrees Fahrenheit.  Although this may not sound too cold, the temperature in this mountain range is constantly changing according to the elevation. The lower the elevation, the lower the temperature will be.  This constant variation of temperature is something the Yeti has evolved to with its thick fur coat.
			<br><br>
			The Yeti will usually claim a cave found in the side of a mountain.  The Yeti is an intelligent being, having the mind and mental capability similar to apes. As a result and mostly after trial and error in the Yeti's free time, their home usually ends up well organized. Snow could be piled in a corner as a bed.
