		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Sunfish spend most of their lives submerged in water, swimming at various levels but when they do come up to the surface, they spend time on their sides using the suns heat to recharge. 
			Normally, Sunfish are solitary animals but they are sometimes seen traveling packs to cleaning areas where they find other fish to help rid them of parasites. 
			They have four teeth in their mouths that are used like a beak to break up harder organisms and other teeth located in the throat that are used to grind the food into smaller pieces.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			I really like that sunfish - while being descendent from bony fish - are actually cartilaginous which allows them to grow much larger than other fish. Nature is pretty cool!
