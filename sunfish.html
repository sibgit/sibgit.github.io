        <h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
        <p>
            There are different types of sunfish. The Ocean sunfish, also known as the common mola, are native to the temperate and tropical waters of every ocean in the world. 
        </p>

        <h3>Diet </h3>
        <p>
            Sunfish are actually generalist predators that consume mostly small fish (such as flounder), fish (eel) larvae, 
            squid, other molluscs, crustaceans, and other soft-bodied invertebrates, with jellyfish and salps making up only around 
            15% of the diet. Occasionally, they will ingest eel grass. This range of food items indicates that the sunfish feeds 
            at many levels, from the surface to deep water, and occasionally down to the seafloor in some areas.
        </p>

        <h3> Behaviour </h3>
        <p>
            The mating practices of the ocean sunfish are poorly understood, but spawning areas have been suggested in the North Atlantic, 
            South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian oceans. Females of the species can produce more eggs than any other 
            known vertebrate, up to 300 million at a time. Sunfish eggs are released into the water and externally fertilized by sperm.
