		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Although early research suggested sunfish moved around mainly by drifting with ocean currents,
			individuals have been recorded swimming 26 km (16 mi) in a day at a cruising speed of 3.2 km/h (1.7 kn).
			While this might be the case most of the time, they are also capable of moving rapidly when feeding or
			avoiding predators, to the extent that they can vertically leap out of water. Contrary to the perception
			that sunfish spend much of their time basking at the surface, M. mola adults actually spend a large portion
			of their lives actively hunting at depths greater than 200 m (660 ft), occupying both the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones.
