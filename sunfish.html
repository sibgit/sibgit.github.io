		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
			Ocean sunfish are native to the temperate and tropical waters of every ocean in the world.[18] Mola genotypes appear to vary widely between the Atlantic and Pacific, but genetic differences between individuals in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are minimal.[30]

Although early research suggested sunfish moved around mainly by drifting with ocean currents, individuals have been recorded swimming 26 km (16 mi) in a day at a cruising speed of 3.2 km/h (1.7 kn).[24] While this might be the case most of the time, they are also capable of moving rapidly when feeding or avoiding predators, to the extent that they can vertically leap out of water. Contrary to the perception that sunfish spend much of their time basking at the surface, M. mola adults actually spend a large portion of their lives actively hunting at depths greater than 200 m (660 ft), occupying both the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones.[31]

Sunfish are most often found in water warmer than 10 째C (50 째F);[31] prolonged periods spent in water at temperatures of 12 째C (54 째F) or lower can lead to disorientation and eventual death.[27] Surface basking behavior, in which a sunfish swims on its side, presenting its largest profile to the sun, may be a method of "thermally recharging" following dives into deeper, colder water in order to feed.[30][32] Sightings of the fish in colder waters outside of its usual habitat, such as those southwest of England, may be evidence of increasing marine temperatures,[33][34] although the proximity of England's southwestern coast to the Gulf Stream means that many of these sightings may also be the result of the fish being carried to Europe by the current.[35]

Sunfish are usually found alone, but occasionally in pairs

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
		        ?? Sunfish are generalist predators that consume largely small fishes, fish larvae, squid, and crustaceans. 
                        ?? Sea jellies and salps, once thought to be the primary prey of sunfish, make up only 15% of a sunfish's diet.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>
			?? It has a flattened body and is as tall as it is long.

			Females of the species can produce more eggs than any other known vertebrate,[5] up to 300,000,000 at a time.
			It looks like a prehistoric fish
