		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
		The ocean sunfish inhabits temperate and tropical oceans worldwide, favouring surface waters but occasionally diving deep. They are found in both coastal and offshore waters, particularly in areas rich in jellyfish and other small organisms, which make up their primary diet. Sunfish migrate seasonally and follow ocean currents, enabling them to travel long distances and access new food sources. Populations exist in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with their distribution varying based on seasonal shifts, moving to deeper waters in colder months to conserve energy and avoid predators.

		<h3>Diet</h3>
		<p>
			Sunfishes are demanding gourmet that only visit 5-star restaurants. There meal of choice is in general oysters of the finest selection, and seaweed salad. They are also very fond of Italian wine.
		</p>

		<h3>Behaviour</h3>
		<p>
			Sunfish spend most of their lives submerged in water, swimming at various levels but when they do come up to the surface, they spend time on their sides using the suns heat to recharge. 
			Normally, Sunfish are solitary animals but they are sometimes seen traveling packs to cleaning areas where they find other fish to help rid them of parasites. 
			They have four teeth in their mouths that are used like a beak to break up harder organisms and other teeth located in the throat that are used to grind the food into smaller pieces.

		<h3>What I like about this animal</h3>
		<p>

			I really like that sunfish - while being descendent from bony fish - are actually cartilaginous which allows them to grow much larger than other fish. Nature is pretty cool! 
			I really appreciate the Sunfish's ability to be so calm and serene, even when the ocean is raging around it. It's a great reminder to stay calm and collected in the face of adversity.
