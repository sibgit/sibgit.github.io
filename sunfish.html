		<h3>Habitat and distribution</h3>
		<p>
		The ocean sunfish inhabits temperate and tropical oceans worldwide, favouring surface waters but occasionally diving deep. They are found in both coastal and offshore waters, particularly in areas rich in jellyfish and other small organisms, which make up their primary diet. Sunfish migrate seasonally and follow ocean currents, enabling them to travel long distances and access new food sources. Populations exist in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with their distribution varying based on seasonal shifts, moving to deeper waters in colder months to conserve energy and avoid predators.
